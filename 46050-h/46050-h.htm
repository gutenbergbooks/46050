<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>It has long been held that the laws of the Israelites, as revealed by
God to Moses, by him embodied in the books of the Pentateuch and
since preserved by the zealous care of the Jewish people, are incomparable.
Accordingly they have been adopted professedly by most
Christian nations and were early accepted by our own king Alfred<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
as the basis of the law system of this our land.</p>

<p>We live in an age of devotion to comparative methods, when it is
an article of faith to hold that the most fruitful means to attain a
clear understanding of the exact nature of anything is to compare it
with its like. This comparative method forms a large part of
modern scientific research and, with proper safeguards and reserves,
has become a favourite weapon of literary research into the history of
human institutions.</p>

<p>Long ago, as it seems to us, <span class="smcap">Sir Henry Maine</span> used it<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> when he
wrote his <i>History of Early Law</i>. As a consequence of his investigations
and those of many who have followed in his footsteps, the Science of
Comparative Law has grown up. All the great law systems of the
world have been classified and compared, and comparative lawyers felt
qualified to assign to any new-found fragment of ancient law its true
position in their schemes. The results had rather confirmed than
traversed ancient claims for the supremacy of Mosaic Laws. Men
had settled down to the belief that we might compare, and that to its
great advantage, the Legislation of Moses with the Roman Laws of
the XII Tables, with the Indian Laws of Manu or the Greek Code
of Gortyna. We had recognized the broad outlines of a process of
evolution and begun to understand the way in which, as a people
advanced along the path of progress in the elements of civilization,
similar human needs called forth similar solutions of the questions of
right and wrong.</p>

<p>Nevertheless much remained obscure in many ancient legislations.
It was the opinion of <span class="smcap">Jhering</span>,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> the great authority on Roman Law,
that for the ultimate solution of the puzzles of Roman Law we should
have to go back to Babylon. In his days comparatively little was
known about the laws of Babylonia, and that little was badly attested.
Men were still of opinion that the Mosaic Law was the oldest of which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
we had any trustworthy account and that Babylonian laws, if there
ever were any worthy of the name, must have been more barbarous
and unformed.</p>

<p>Then there came, in the early days of this century, a great surprise,
calling at once for much revision of our neatly arranged systems
of knowledge. A Code of Laws was discovered, certainly the oldest
known, by far the most complete and best attested, and at the same
time the most advanced of all but the most modern.</p>

<p>Fragments of it were already known from late copies, had been
recognized as probably parts of a Babylonian Code of Law, were even
conjecturally styled the Code of Hammurabi by <span class="smcap">Professor Friedrich
Delitzsch</span>,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> but very little could be concluded from them. Then
suddenly at Susa in Elam was discovered practically the whole text
of it. Ever since it has been the subject of profound study from all
points of view.</p>

<p>The comparison of this Code of Hammurabi with the Laws of
Moses was bound to be made. Many reasons would suggest the likelihood
that much similarity would be observed between two early
legislations both Semitic in complexion. Comparisons with other
ancient codes were equally sure to be made and the differences
naturally to be expected would be carefully weighed and considered.
But while most surprising results came out of these comparisons,
especially in the realm of Roman Law, a much keener interest has
attached to the comparison with Hebrew Law, not only because of the
sacred nature of the Old Testament, but even more because this had
been the special study of the Higher Critics. These scholars had
almost decided what their view of the composition of the Pentateuch
should be, what were the ultimate sources implied, what dates should
be assigned to the constituent documents, and the arguments to be
considered valid in such discussions. Those who rejected the Higher
Critical conclusions flew at once to the new-found Code for arguments
to refute Higher Criticism; while Higher Critics found confirmations
in many directions.&#8216;</p>

<p>It may be hoped that this side issue has lost its interest, and that
a hearing may now be obtained for a simple attempt to use the two
legislations for mutual understanding. When on the appearance of
the Code in its first edition I lectured upon it at Queens&#8217; College,
Cambridge, it was solely as a new document of human history. When
a month or two later I was privileged to point out its &#8216;significance
for comparison with the Hebrew legislation&#8217; in a paper read before
the Cambridge Theological Society,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> of which an abstract appeared in
the <i>Journal of Theological Studies</i> (Jan. 1903), it is probable enough
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
that the contrasts to the Mosaic Law were more apparent than the
likenesses. In the next few months there was ready for press an
extensive work on the Code, illustrating its meaning from the innumerable
legal documents, most of them contemporary, which had
been my study for years. As bearing on this comparison I soon
found that a baldly literal translation of the Code gave a most Biblical
turn to its phraseology which the easy, lucid, but peraphrastic
renderings given by others perpetually disguised. The general likenesses,
Semitic characteristics, and apparent cases of adaptation were
separately classed and those most suggestive of dependence insisted
upon. The index of subjects compiled from the Code and contemporary
legal documents appeared to constitute a substantial advance
in the knowledge of ancient law.</p>

<p>Of all this work, prepared in 1904, it was not possible to publish
more than the translation, under the title <i>The Oldest Code of Laws
in the World</i> (T. &amp; T. Clark, Edinburgh), with a selection from the
index. The other results were freely communicated to various
scholars, but it was not without some pangs that I saw most of them
attained in time independently. Later an article on the <i>Code of
Hammurabi</i> in the Supplementary Volume of Hastings&#8217;s <i>Bible Dictionary</i>
and one on <i>Babylonian Law</i> in the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>
afforded me the chance of setting out some results of my research
upon the Code in its relation to the ancient civilization of Babylonia,
with a rapid glance at its relations to Israelite Law. When writing
a work for the American public on <i>Assyrian and Babylonian Laws,
Contracts, and Letters</i>, I expanded some parts of this treatment.</p>

<p>I trust that I may be pardoned for thus simply stating why, when
the British Academy conferred upon me the great honour of inviting
me to deliver the Schweich Lectures for 1912, I selected the subject
of <i>Babylonian Law in its relation to the Laws of Moses</i>. It was
a subject in which I had taken an interest for some years, and I was
anxious to seize an opportunity of making public the work done
in 1903-4.</p>

<p>A very large amount of work has been done by others on various
aspects of the Code of Hammurabi, especially on the Continent, where
the facilities for publication appear to be greatly superior to those in
England. What is done here is, however, of excellent quality; and
<span class="smcap">Mr. S. A. Cook</span> undertook a detailed comparison with the laws of
Hammurabi and other codes which<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> leaves very little to be desired.
<span class="smcap">Mr. St. Chad Boscawen</span> in his <i>First of Empires</i> stated some
interesting opinions, and <span class="smcap">Mr. Chilperic Edwards</span> has given a fresh
translation. <span class="smcap">Professor R. F. Harper</span> gave a useful handbook of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
text with new translation, index, vocabulary, sign-list, &amp;c., which
makes the study simple to those who can read cuneiform.</p>

<p>Reference may be made to the Bibliographies given in these and
other books listed in the Bibliography printed on pp. 65 ff.</p>

<p>With such a volume of literature already published, it may seem
superfluous to add a further contribution. Indeed, when the present
writer read an account of the Code to the Cambridge Theological
Society in October 1902, he was quite content to call his paper <i>The
Code of Hammurabi, fresh material for comparison with the Mosaic
Code</i>. He would have been well content to leave it as such, being
rather concerned to furnish material for study than to make direct
contributions to the application of it to subjects beyond his competence.
Much that has been published on this comparison, however,
seems to him really inadequate or so ill-considered that it appears to
be a duty to submit a different view. He is fully conscious that it is
only one view and may prove to be wrong. Yet it seems to him that
it is a view which takes account of more facts than any other, and,
while not admitting of formal proof, is both reasonable and probable.</p>

<p>Briefly stated, the view thus taken is that the Code of Hammurabi
belongs to the same group of ancient legislations as the Hebrew, and
that both are compromises between two distinct types of law.</p>

<p>One type is that which is perhaps best seen in the customs of the
Arabs, as still surviving among the modern Bedawin, and known to
us from the ancient Arabic writers. This has been called primitive
Semitic custom. The Israelites, before their entrance into Canaan,
as a nomad pastoral people, would be governed by such law, if it can
be called law. The dynasty to which Hammurabi belonged was
foreign to Babylonia. It owed its rise to an incursion of a Semitic
people. That Semites were in Babylonia long before is true, but this
was a fresh invasion by a probably nomad pastoral race. They had
previously obeyed the same primitive laws as it is assumed the
Israelites did before their settlement in Canaan. Forming as they
did the ruling race in Babylonia, they yet clung with Oriental conservatism
to their ancient customs. Even such a powerful ruler as
Hammurabi could not, or at any rate did not see fit to, entirely
change those customs. In the period when the Laws of Moses were
instituted, the Israelites were similarly the ruling race in Canaan.
Their earlier laws, as known to us, show the same conservation of
primitive custom, and that of the same type.</p>

<p>The other type of law is that due to a settled community. In
Babylonia it may have been evolved through long ages. It may have
been, and probably was, largely due to a non-Semitic people, usually
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
called Sumerians, whose racial affinities are not yet well made out.
These were conquered by the Semites of Hammurabi&#8217;s race. In
Canaan too the invading Israelites found a long-settled people in
possession. They were governed by very similar laws to those of the
settled Babylonians. That these laws had been imported from
Babylonia is open to question. Much that is common to the laws of
the two settled communities may have arisen independently. There
is as yet no evidence that the Canaanites were of the Sumerian stock.[7]
But Babylonian influence on the Canaanite law is quite conceivable,
and is supported by historical evidence of long-continued intercourse
between Babylonia and the West. As the Israelites became a settled
population many of their nomad customs must have become inappropriate.
They might have evolved new laws. They might have taken
over the laws of the Canaanites, so far as these were innocent, or not
too obnoxious to Hebrew prejudices. Exactly which course they
followed in each case is a matter of history. The historical evidence
may be inconclusive. We must make the best of it.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the Code of Hammurabi is compared with the
Laws of Moses, the common material may be due to one of two
common sources, primitive Semitic law (otherwise nomad law) and
the law of settled communities. For the latter we may hesitate to
fix on a racial name. But it is not necessarily that of any and every
settled community. Inasmuch as we find it in its most developed
form in the Code of Hammurabi, we may call it Babylonian. On the
other hand, as the oldest known witness to the primitive type is the
same Code, we may call that Babylonian also. In this modified sense
we shall be able to speak of the Laws of Moses as being primitive
Semitic law modified by Babylonian influence. That, however, would
be a description easily misunderstood if divorced from its context.</p>

<p>It is better to say that both legislations are compromises between
the two types of law, that they show different degrees of preponderance
of one or the other type, and that the Laws of Moses manifest
an independent development strongly influenced by the Code of
Hammurabi.</p>

<p>We may still claim an independent development of the Laws of
Moses.</p>

<p>For during the whole time that the Israelites were in Canaan they
were, as usually supposed, independent of Babylonian rule. If they
adopted laws which were already prevalent in Babylonia, we may be
sure it was not solely because they were Babylonian. This may be
disputed. For there were times when, if we may believe their own
tradition, they did receive embassies from Babylonia, or even adopt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
Assyrian cults. This kind of influence might conceivably lead to the
adoption of Babylonian or Assyrian law, which latter was always
practically the Code of Hammurabi.</p>

<p>The Israelites may never have adopted Canaanite law consciously,
but always supposed themselves to be creators of their own laws.
But they could hardly avoid knowing the Canaanite law. When
a man does as his neighbours do, he may be perfectly independent in
his choice so to do, as some men count independence. But it is usual
to regard him as influenced by their conduct. Even when he decides
to do the very opposite to what they do we may contend that he was
influenced by his knowledge of their conduct. Reaction may be
claimed as a sign of independence, but it is also a sign of influence.
The truth always is that every action exhibits both independence and
influence. We may hold to the explanation that a man&#8217;s circumstances
determine him, but we must then give a wide meaning to
circumstance.</p>

<p>Now one of Israel&#8217;s circumstances was Canaan. The Canaanites
had settled laws, and to some extent those laws must have embodied
the results of experience of what was suitable in Canaan. Israel
might have arrived at the same results, by the same way. It is,
however, surely difficult to deny that they availed themselves of
Canaanite experience and adopted Canaanite laws. If they did
so at all, it is mere quibbling to deny Canaanite influence. Even
if they had so framed their laws as to avoid a likeness to Canaanite
laws altogether, that would still show Canaanite influence. That they
did neither, but achieved a totally distinct type of law, can alone
show complete independence. That they did not adopt all Canaanite
customs, but made a selection, shows the best sort of independence.
That there was always a strong tendency to adopt too much that was
Canaanite, is the lament of their best teachers. These also protested
against much that was Israelite custom. But it is not certain that
these protests were always against what had been Canaanite. It may
sometimes have been more primitive custom, properly more Israelite.
For, at any rate, regarded from the point of civilization, we must
admit that the Canaanites were more advanced.</p>

<p>It might now be supposed that the differences of opinion which
have been called forth by comparisons of the Hebrew and Babylonian
legislations resolve themselves into this: that one opinion emphasizes
the independence, the other dwells upon the influence. That is partly
true, but does not cover all the divergence. For when similarities are
accounted for by a common Semitic origin, or an <i>Urgesetz</i>, or as the
natural outcome of human intellect acting similarly in similar
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
circumstances, not all the factors of the problem are taken into
account. These might be adequate solutions if Israel had been
separated from all other Semitic races and entered an empty Canaan.
They might even account for the similarities, such as they are,
between the laws of the Babylonians and the Aztecs. Men everywhere
do reach the invention of pottery, but man anywhere will use
the pot he finds ready made.</p>

<p>What these contentions leave out of account is the existence of
ready-made laws. This cannot be denied. The Canaanites were
there, by all admitted. They must have had laws and customs.
No one surely denies that. What proof could ever be produced that
Israel did not adopt such as were convenient? In the selections and
rejections which the Israelites made they showed whatever independence
we may give them credit for. That they could have invented
the same themselves, or obtained them elsewhere, is perfectly irrelevant.
To assert that they did invent them, not adopt them, is to describe
the same fact in different words. It looks very like perversity. We
may pretend to have invented something exactly like what some one
else has done before, but the Patent Laws usually prevent our getting
much profit out of it. Even when we introduce judicious little
variations there is sometimes astonishing reluctance to credit us
with the inventiveness which we feel to be our own.</p>

<p>Some writers have boldly gone to the root of the matter and
minimized the extent to which Canaan was influenced by Babylonia.
This is perfectly legitimate. We cannot be too cautious how we use
the facts of history. Eastern lands show to-day that the tide
of conquest may roll over them and leave little trace behind. Egypt
was influential in Palestine once, but there is not much trace of its
influence in Canaan. This, however, is not entirely absent. Explorations
in Palestine do exhibit considerable traces of Egyptian
influence in some directions. What traces of Israelite influence are
there to compare with it? Here, however, the question is being
taken into a totally irrelevant field.</p>

<p>The Canaanites adopted exactly what suited them, they submitted
to what was imposed, just so long as they were obliged. That they
adopted all the Babylonian laws is absurd to suppose. Just as absurd
as to suppose that under Israelite rule, they adopted all Israelite law
or custom. If they had, there would then be nothing left for Israel
to select or reject. Let us give them credit for some independence
even when conquered. Their law was a Canaanite version of Babylonian
or Israelite law, in any case. If they had it written down in
cuneiform even, it was probably translated into Canaanite. Some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
would maintain that that was Hebrew. At any rate, what we know
of it is very similar. But that they could have escaped Babylonian
influence on their laws is almost inconceivable. What we know
of the Laws of Moses either proves that they were, in some cases,
practically the same as Babylonian, or else shows direct Babylonian
influence. We may turn this evidence the other way and say that
the Code of Hammurabi shows Canaanite influence, from what we
can see in it to be like the Laws of Moses. There are not lacking
some to call the dynasty of Hammurabi &#8216;Canaanite&#8217;. But the
evidence rather goes to show that what Hammurabi&#8217;s race contributed
to his Code was more like what Israel contributed to the Laws of
Moses and not at all like what a settled folk, such as the Canaanites,
would contribute. We may perhaps concede that the Canaanites
were Semitic and of the same race as those who conquered Babylon
and founded Hammurabi&#8217;s Dynasty. At that time they may have
been nomads, as the Israelites were later when they came into Canaan.
But if, in Canaan, they retained a primitive type of law and evolved
a settled law or adopted it from some previous inhabitants, so that
their law also, like the Code of Hammurabi and the Laws of Moses,
was a blend of the two types; then we have no longer the means to
separate their particular blend from the other two.</p>

<p>It is of great importance to discern what was Canaanite law, and
we shall find some traces of it. But on the whole, we can only infer
it by separating from Israelite law what they are likely to have
contributed to it. It is not a very safe method, but we have no
other yet. Some contributions are made by the Tell-el-Amarna
tablets. More may be expected from fresh discoveries. There is
another indirect method. The laws of Phoenicia and Carthage may
give some help. Even the Roman Laws of the XII Tables may be
of use. They do show surprising likenesses to the Code of Hammurabi.
How these laws could find their way from Babylonia to Rome is not
easy to imagine. Phoenicia may be thought of as an intermediary.
If this be tolerated as a solution, then we may assume that where
Babylon agrees with Rome, especially if Phoenicia can be shown to
agree also, it is probable that Canaan was also very similar. If then
Israel is the same as well we can hardly doubt whence the original
motive came.</p>

<p>There are possibly some indications that the Laws of Moses mark
an advance on the customs which ruled in the days of the Patriarchs.
In view of modern critical contentions that these stories of the
Patriarchs are a sort of reflection back into the past of what the later
writers felt would be appropriate to the time in which they set the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
eponymous heroes of the old days, we may hesitate to regard such
attributed customs as trustworthy for a comparison. Nor is it beyond
question whether the Israelites ever obeyed the laws of Bedouin
Arabs. But assuming that on their entrance into Canaan the
Israelites acquired fresh customs, we may make some important
reflections. Supposing there was a change in law, can we detect it?
If we can, what exactly does it establish? Have we merely a change
due to a change of habitat, or have other factors to be taken into
account?</p>

<p>Now we may question whether this change of law was due to the
change in habits from a nomadic life to a settled state, simply and
solely. The Israelites when they invaded Canaan found there an
already settled people, if we may believe their own account. There
were cities and houses and crops already there. From secular
sources, such as the Tell-el-Amarna tablets, we know that some time
before the conquest there was an advanced state of civilization in
Canaan. We even know the names of many kings and cities. What
became of this settled population? It is contrary to all analogy and
to the Israelite tradition itself to suppose that they were all exterminated.
They were obviously possessed of a higher civilization than
their invaders, already, what the Israelites in time became, a settled
people. Can it be thought that they exerted no influence on their
conquerors? We cannot but expect that as the Israelites became
settled they would adopt the customs of the settled population. We
have it on record that their own teachers charged them with doing
this. Some of these customs must have been innocent enough, and
such as would be equally appropriate for Israelites when settled.
Others would be obnoxious to the racial prejudices, religious or social,
of the more conservative Israelites. There would naturally be conflict
in some cases between conflicting views of right. In some cases one
view would prevail, in others a different result would follow. Even
compromises are not inconceivable. To insist that all laws in Israel
were the product of the national genius, even if dignified by the name
of revelation, is to make a heavy demand on our credulity.</p>

<p>It seems then to be a reasonable working hypothesis that the
Israelites did at first succeed in impressing a primitive type of law on
the land, especially in those matters which were not entirely unsuited
to both peoples. This seems to be supported by the character of
what is regarded as the earliest law code in Israel. We at any rate
may say that they themselves regarded such as their laws. It would
require strong proof before we could admit that the surviving conquered
people obeyed them too. As the Israelites became a settled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
people they may have invented fresh laws. It does require proof,
however, that these were invented, and not already the laws of the
conquered race. Provided that they were not too repugnant to
the Hebrew genius it would be a step towards unification to adopt
existing laws. Proof must be overwhelming that they were not
adopted before we can think otherwise. The selective power to
adopt or reject, to modify and concede, completely guards independence.
On the other hand, unless we can prove that there was no
adoption at all, we admit influence. Here the controversialists seem
to have confounded the issue. They either deny all influence in order
to maintain independence, or they destroy all independence by
hardening influence into origination. On either assumption Moses
does not get credit for much initiative.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have not considered the question whether the settled
Canaanites were governed by the Code of Hammurabi before the
Israelites came. Some have tried to make the whole controversy turn
on this point. It is difficult to see how an answer can be given to
that question, except by the discovery of a copy of the Code itself in
a pre-Israelitish city. If, on the other hand, we admit that the civilization
of Canaan was essentially Babylonian before the conquest, we
may suppose that it was governed by Babylonian laws, at any rate, to
a large extent. It is to be expected that there would be local
variations. Can we test such an hypothesis? We do now know
what Babylonian law was in the time of Hammurabi some five
hundred years before the conquest of Canaan. We do know that in
Babylonia that law remained practically unchanged for a thousand
years longer. We must then admit that if Babylonian law had sway
in Canaan at all, it must have been that of the Code to all intents
and purposes. We thus have a linked chain of hypotheses. If
Canaanite civilization was once an offshoot of Babylonian, and
gradually asserted its influence over Hebrew legislation, then we
ought to find more and more likeness to the Code of Hammurabi in
Israelite law as time goes on. For that purpose we may concede as
much as the critics wish to claim for their arrangement of successive
codes in the Books of Moses before the Code was discovered. The
later the law is, according to them, the more likely will it be on our
hypothesis to resemble the Code. We assume that the Canaanite
element in the nation held on to their old law, while submitting to
the innovations introduced by the invaders. If the other proposition
holds true, either this was the fact, or the particular law, instead of
being late, must be redated before Canaanite conservatism was
overcome.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span></p>

<p>We may now state the broad principle to be tested. The more
primitive laws in the Mosaic Codes are properly Israelite, and an
inheritance from old nomadic custom. The more advanced laws are
due to gradually assimilated Canaanite sources. These should show,
if not identity, at least affinity with the Code of Hammurabi. If
they do not, we have several alternative views to weigh. Either the
law of Hammurabi did not continue to bear sway in Canaan, or it
never did on that point, or the law is a new creation. The mere
fact that a given, late, non-primitive law in Israel is not found in the
Code of Hammurabi proves nothing as to the origin of any unconnected
law. We have to do with a long chain, of which we can only compare
the two ends. What happened between we do not know.</p>

<p>We may do well to clear out of the way some obstacles that might
at least distract attention. An apparently strong point has been
made against any connexion between the legislations on the score of
philology. It is said that while the names of the things dealt with
are the same, the technical terms are different. Thus, while the words
for silver and gold, sheep and oxen, fields and houses are the same,
those for rulers, for laws and customs are different. This is partly an
argument from silence, partly an ignoration of facts. It is true that
&#8216;to marry&#8217;, in Babylonian, is <i>a&#7723;&acirc;zu</i>, and in Hebrew <i>l&#257;&#7731;&#257;h</i>; but in
Assyrian it is <i>la&#7731;&ucirc;</i>. Now we may reply that the Assyrian shows that
it was once <i>la&#7731;&ucirc;</i> in Babylonian also. The connexion for which we
contend does not demand transliteration, but translation. What
would be thought of any student of mediaeval history who denied the
influence of Roman law on English because Latin words were not
used? If this be the test, the Tell-el-Amarna tablets show much
stronger Babylonian influence than we contend for. Practically the
whole of their vocabulary is Babylonian. They also show that the
writers had words of their own, Semitic, if not Hebrew, which they
glossed by Babylonian. Some think the Israelites learnt their Hebrew
in Canaan. If the Canaanites were speaking Hebrew and had Babylonian
laws, the translating into Hebrew was done before the conquest.
The fact is that the whole philological argument breaks down unless
we can show that the words compared are the only words in use with
the same meaning. The lexicons do not on the whole afford a sufficient
source for the comparison. They embody little of the vocabulary of
the legal documents or contracts.</p>

<p>Of much more cogency than the agreement of separate items would
be a similarity of order in the arrangement of the common matter.
<span class="smcap">Professor D. H. M&uuml;ller</span> has found some interesting examples of this
in comparing the Code with the Twelve Tables. This leads him and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
others to suspect an Oriental influence on early Roman Law. That
must remain little more than a suspicion unless we can indicate the
route by which such influence could come in. In the case of Israel
the problem is to show how it could be kept out.</p>

<p>A comparison of the Code with the Laws of Moses from this point
of view is greatly hampered by the fact that the latter are not in any
particular order. If we follow the critical division of the material we
find that we are left with a variety of legislations of very different
dates and qualities well shown in <i>The Hexateuch</i>, or in articles in
<i>Dict. Bible</i>. It will hardly be claimed for any one of these that we
have it still in a completely preserved form. If so, then the intention
must have been to leave a great deal to the action of the well-known
customary law.</p>

<p>This solution, however, is not to be rejected off-hand. For the
Code of Hammurabi does not deal expressly with all cases: it omits
murder. Hence we must not insist that any Israelite code either,
when first promulgated, covered all cases of crime and misdemeanour.
There is, however, good ground for saying that each Israelite legislation
included some things which are now omitted from the Books of
Moses. If this be denied, then we must account for the very incomplete
nature of these codes. We may do so thus. It was only to be
expected that a new legislation would deal chiefly with cases that had
not hitherto been decided, or on which old law had grown obsolete, or
where conflicting views of right had come to be held. If, then, we
can regard any Israelite code, as now known to us, as being on the
whole preserved in its original order, even though other portions
have been suppressed or abrogated, we may compare the order of its
clauses with those of the Code of Hammurabi. We need not take
account of the suspicions which will now be thrown on that order by
critics, unless they were expressed before the Code of Hammurabi was
known. And on the whole case we may plead with respect to any
Israelite code, that either it once covered much more than it does, as
we know it now, or that its incompleteness is due to the existence of
well-established custom on the omitted points, and that it simply
enacted changes.</p>

<p>As a result of the intensive work done on the Code of Hammurabi
itself by the many scholars who have devoted their study to it, we
now understand it far better than before. It would be invidious to
attempt to assign each step to its own author, and I expressly disclaim
any originality for views that I may have held long before some one
else published them, but it may add to the confidence with which my
readers follow me, if they remember that nearly everything has been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
independently reached by two students at least. My chief desire, however,
is to make my views clear, and to state my reasons as intelligibly
as may be.</p>

<p>I propose to deal first with the external features of the Code of
Hammurabi, dwelling chiefly on those that are useful for a comparison
with the Israelite legislation. Then, secondly, I will point out briefly
the types of likeness between the Babylonian and Hebrew laws, and
the associated contrasts. Then I will venture to discuss in my way
and attempt to estimate the extent of dependence, if any. But
I cannot claim to have said the last word on any point raised here.
We are still at the mercy of future discovery. Let us hope it will be
merciful to some theories, at any rate.</p>

<p class="center f12">THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE LAWS<br />
OF BABYLONIA AND THE LAWS OF<br />
THE HEBREW PEOPLES</p>

<h2>LECTURE I</h2>

<p>The discovery of the principal record of the system of enactments
now known by the name of the Code of Hammurabi was made in
December 1901 and January 1902.</p>

<p>At Susa, the ancient Persepolis, named &#8216;Shushan the Palace&#8217; in the
Book of Daniel, situated in Persia, once the ancient capital of Elam, the
excavators, working under the direction of J. de Morgan for the French
Ministry of Instruction, found three large pieces of black diorite,
which when fitted together formed a monolith stela, about 2&middot;25 metres
high, tapering upwards from 1&middot;9 to 1&middot;65 metres. The stone itself
is in the Louvre Museum in Paris, but a beautiful reproduction of it
stands in the Babylonian Room of the British Museum.</p>

<p>At the top of the stela is engraved in low bas-relief a representation
of Hammurabi himself receiving his laws from a seated god, usually
taken to be the sun-god Shamash, who was regarded in Babylonia as
the supreme judge of gods and men, whose children or attendants
were Mish&acirc;ru and Kittu or Rectitude and Right.</p>

<p>Below this scene begins the inscription, written in Semitic Babylonian,
then called Akkadian, and arranged in parallel narrow columns.
These columns were read from left to right and downward precisely
like those of a modern newspaper, but each column goes across the
stela like a belt. Consequently a reader must turn his head on one
side to read the inscription.</p>

<p>On the front of the stela sixteen columns are preserved, and traces
of five more which have been intentionally erased. Analogy with
similar cases among the many Babylonian monuments found at
Susa, on which the original inscription has been partly cut out to
make way for the name and titles of Shutruk-nakhunde the king
of Elam who had carried them off as trophies of his conquests in
Babylonia, suggests that a like purpose was entertained with respect
to this stela but only partly carried out. Unfortunately a break in
the text of the Code is thus caused which our other records have only
partly enabled us to restore.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>The back of the stela completely preserves twenty-eight columns,
except where a few natural faults in the stone obscure the characters.
The whole inscription may be estimated as having once contained
forty-nine columns, four thousand lines, and about eight thousand
words.</p>

<p>The characters are of an archaic type, much fancied by the kings
of the First Dynasty of Babylon, of whom Hammurabi was the sixth
in succession, and paralleled by other inscriptions of his. Thus, apart
from his own words, we can date it as a contemporary record of the
text. It was undoubtedly engraved on the stone by a stone-cutter
working from a copy of the text written on clay in the cursive script
of the period. This accounts for one or two scribal errors, which are,
however, easily detected and readily corrected.</p>

<p>Fragments of duplicates were also found at Susa, showing that the
text was executed in several copies, probably to be set up in different
cities. At least one fragment of a contemporary copy written on clay
was found at Nippur, showing that the text was also circulated in
writing at the time of its promulgation.</p>

<p>There are fragments of several copies preserved in the British
Museum, made for the Library of Ashurbanipal, king of Assyria
668-626 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> These are in Assyrian script and show some variants
which are useful as synonymous renderings. From their phraseology,
however, <span class="smcap">Dr. Br. Meissner</span>, who first published most of them,
concluded that they were early Babylonian laws,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> while <span class="smcap">Professor
Friedrich Delitzsch</span>, who commented upon them, named them
the Code of Hammurabi.<a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">8</a> Further, a late Babylonian copy exists at
Berlin, and was published by <span class="smcap">Dr. F. E. Peiser</span>.<a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>These late copies show that the inscription was edited in a series
of tablets or &#8216;Books&#8217; called <i>Ninu Anum tsirum</i>, from the first words
of the text, just as Genesis was called Bereshith from its first word or
other books of the Old Testament were named in the same way.
Another series was called <i>Din&acirc;ni sha Hammurabi</i>, from the first
words of the Epilogue or closing portion of the text. From these
editions we may conclude that the Code was known and studied both
in Assyria and Babylonia at least as late as the seventh century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
Whether any monumental stela with this inscription survived so long
after the Susa examples had been carried off is not yet certain. But
these editions are of extreme value as indications that a knowledge
of the provisions of the Code existed so long and was preserved so
accurately.</p>

<p>We may note that there is a very great advantage for students
of this ancient body of law in the fact that beside a long tradition
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
accurately preserved we have a practically complete autograph of the
Code as originally promulgated. There can be no suspicion of overwriting,
interpolation or gloss, no tendency-redaction, no revision in
the interests of any party, priestly or political. We have no need to
seek for any conjectural restoration, except for a few erased clauses
or defaced characters. We have no call to split up the text<a name="FNanchor_10_8" id="FNanchor_10_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_8" class="fnanchor">10</a> into
strata as embodying older laws, though we know such earlier codes
had existed perhaps a thousand years before. A comparison with
such fragments of earlier law as we possess shows indeed much
change if not always progress in that period, and marks on the whole
a great advance in civilization.</p>

<p>It is a task still reserved for the students of Babylonian law to make
careful researches into the growth of social institutions and the
development of legal conceptions which led up to this Code. It will
prove a most instructive study if pursued apart from the presumptions
deduced from other and unrelated areas which now form a body
of dogmatic prejudice from which many scholars seem unable to
emancipate their thought. We must, however, start our investigations
at a point where the Code has already arrived, when it must be
treated as the principal landmark in the long history of law in
Babylonia. Whatever may be our view as to what should have been
the evolution of law before that date we must be careful to remember
what that evolution produced.</p>

<p>The date of the Code, as shown by the prologue with which the
text begins, fell in the reign<a name="FNanchor_11_9" id="FNanchor_11_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_9" class="fnanchor">11</a> of the great king Hammurabi, sixth
king of the First Dynasty of Babylon, whose call to the throne,
successful wars, and great benefits to his people, it sets out with
magniloquent phraseology. The list of his achievements thus given
further enables us to fix the year of its redaction as after the fortieth
year of the reign. This may, however, be the date at which our existing
monument was erected rather than that at which the Code was first
promulgated. As this king only reigned forty-three years the date is
very closely fixed. We now know some prominent event for each
year of this long reign, and by means of other inscriptions of his we
can make out a fairly complete sketch of his times for which reference
must be made to the many excellent histories of Babylonia.<a name="FNanchor_12_10" id="FNanchor_12_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_10" class="fnanchor">12</a> As is
well known Hammurabi has frequently been identified with Amraphel
king of Shinar mentioned in the fourteenth chapter of Genesis as
having made war on his rebellious subjects in and around the Dead
Sea area. Amraphel is there associated with Arioch king of Ellasar,
usually identified with R&icirc;m-Sin king of Larsa, with Chedorlaomer
king of Elam and Tidal king of &#8216;Nations&#8217;. The same tradition made
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
him contemporary with Abraham, &#8216;father of the faithful and friend
of God&#8217;, who is said to have migrated with his family from Ur of the
Chaldees to Haran, the chief city and commercial capital of Mesopotamia,
and thence into Palestine. It is interesting to note that
it is precisely with the period of Hammurabi that Hebrew tradition
elects to link up its early memories of origins. We might then be
naturally drawn to examine the native records of the Hammurabi
reign, including its laws, simply to gain a clearer idea of the circumstances
among which Abraham was born and grew up. But there
are other reasons for our effort to study the period. As a record
of early law the Code of Hammurabi is one of the most remarkable
monuments of the history of the human race. Treated as a legal
document the peculiarities of the Code are amazing. Doubtless
an expert in comparative law could have reconstructed a large part
of the Babylonian law from the many thousands of legal documents
of all periods which have come down to us. To a very remarkable
extent this has been done, especially by <span class="smcap">Professor Kohler</span>,
assisted or followed by <span class="smcap">Professor Peiser</span>, <span class="smcap">Professor Meissner</span>,
<span class="smcap">Professor Schorr</span>, <span class="smcap">Professor Ungnad</span> and a score more who
have taken up special points.<a name="FNanchor_13_11" id="FNanchor_13_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_11" class="fnanchor">13</a> My article on Babylonian Law in the
<i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> will give some idea of this work.</p>

<p>But while abundant evidence was available as to commercial matters,
such as the disposal of estates and other property by sale or exchange,
or their assignment by hire, lease, or hypothec, the laws of deposit
and warehousing, commenda or commission, agency, security, pledge,
warranty, the laws of partnership, rules as to debt and interest, loans
with or without security, the family laws relating to marriage, divorce,
adoption, inheritance, maintenance, &amp;c., and many other points were
made out with great clearness, yet much remained obscure.</p>

<p>For the legal documents, deeds, contracts, or the like, while doubtless
absolutely clear to the contemporary parties concerned and
evidently the outcome of long-established legal practice, assumed
much that could only be conjectured from their slight hints. In my
article on Babylonian Law and in <i>Babylonian and Assyrian Laws,
Contracts and Letters</i> I gathered up most of what was then known.</p>

<p>Especially was our knowledge defective in the matter of criminal
law. We had plenty of legal decisions, but they too often merely
recorded the award of the court, and even where the case in dispute
was stated, the suit was nearly always about property. We had little
or no information about such questions as murder, manslaughter,
theft, adultery, assault, and the like. The Code, with its full criminal
sections, was thus doubly welcome.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>The state of society revealed, and its laws, are most remarkable.
The tribal system has disappeared. The city states with their local
customs are being welded into a unity. There is still local government
and district responsibility, but the king&#8217;s judges are over the
local elders, and there is appeal to higher courts, ultimately to the
king himself. The family is the unit, with great measure of family
solidarity and complete indefeasible right over family estate, devolving
its rights to individuals as they form new family units, but
retaining rights of reversion amounting to a strict entail.</p>

<p>There is a settled population, engaged in agriculture and pastoral
pursuits, yet with many industries in the hands of guilds of artisans,
recruited by adoption and apprenticeship, but largely hereditary in
families. There is a highly organized system of military service and
the <i>corv&eacute;e</i> or press-gang for public works, with a feudal tenure,
alongside tenure on payment of tithes and temple dues, and the
metayer system by which the landlord found cattle, agricultural
implements and seed for culture of the fields. Estates bore permanent
responsibilities which went with the land to furnish military service,
produce, supplies, &amp;c., to the state. Other estates were held of the
king, on rent or tribute, the usual lot of conquered territory. There
was a numerous and wealthy body of merchants who were also
bankers or money-lenders and much controlled by the Code, especially
in the interest of the poorer debtors. They were also afforded state
protection and their canvassers carried trade far and wide to every
quarter. There was a highly developed and rapid postal or
messenger system, of which many beside the king availed themselves.</p>

<p>The land was full of populous towns with fixed areas of dependent
villages, remnants of the old city states, now conterminous over the
whole kingdom; counties we might call them, parishes and boroughs.
There were still traces of borough law, but the Code was supreme and
the king&#8217;s justice ran everywhere. Temples, mansions, farms, plantations,
common pasture, feudal estates, existed alongside private ownership
in land.</p>

<p>The state of society bears surprising likenesses to that of Europe
in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>The law itself is no less advanced. Justice has replaced vengeance.
Self-help is restrained, if not suppressed; wrong must be redressed
at law. There is full protection for the weak, the widows and
orphans, as the lawgiver himself points out with pride. Women are
placed in a position of freedom and independence of their husbands,
such as they have only enjoyed in our land since the Married
Women&#8217;s Property Acts. Education was at such a high pitch that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Hammurabi assumes that every injured person would come and read
for himself the laws that applied to his own case, or at least find
a neighbour who could do so.</p>

<p>The nature of the legislation is no less surprising from a comparative
point of view.</p>

<p>In many respects we find the most extraordinary medley of ancient
and modern laws. To take but one or two examples. A belief in
witchcraft is not avowed, but recognized as demanding regulation;
while purgation of the charge is referred to ordeal by water, such as
lingered on so long in Europe.</p>

<p>The extraordinary confidence in the power of the oath to secure
truthful witness is remarkable; but has not died out of our law
courts yet. The purgation by oath is in the Saxon form, and applies
not only to things solely within the knowledge of the accused, as loss
of entrusted goods, but also to manslaughter.</p>

<p>In connexion with feudal tenure we find precisely common-law
dower, the right of a tenant in fee-simple or entail to the enjoyment
for her life of a third of the undevised lands of her husband which he
held in that possession. An attentive examination of the tenure of
a Babylonian retainer of the king, who held land on military service,
or other royal service including public works, subject to strict entail
unless forfeited by failure to carry out commands, will reveal strange
likenesses to the feudal system.</p>

<p>The Romans have usually been regarded as inventing the institution
of the will, as Sir Henry Maine pointed out, which has played so
great a part in modern society, but like the contract, we have it in
the Code and contemporary practice in no merely rudimentary form.
True that in the Code the only case considered is where the will
operates within the family, but other cases seem to occur in practice.
We find that a man can assign even land, garden, or house by a sealed
and witnessed deed to a favourite child, and if so, when his estate is
divided by his children at his death, they cannot claim it as part of the
estate to be divided; the favoured child takes equal share with them
in the estate left beside his own special legacy. The husband too
could leave property to his wife, and she could devise it as she chose,
but only to her children by him; not to her own family, nor children
by a later husband. If a father vowed his daughter to religion, he
could, by sealed and witnessed deed, give her specific freedom of
testamentary disposition of what she received from her father as
a marriage portion on taking her vows. She had a right to a marriage
portion any way, which was in lieu of a share of her father&#8217;s estate.
If she took it on marriage it was her portion for life, and was equal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
to what a son would take as a son&#8217;s share at her father&#8217;s death, but if
she died childless it reverted to her family. On taking a vow, she
would have the same portion as if married, but as she would then die
childless, unless her father gave her power to dispose of it by will, her
brothers or family would resume it.</p>

<p>The importance of status is a well-known characteristic of certain
ancient Codes, and is often commented upon as a feature of special
interest.</p>

<p>The Code recognizes three grades of society by dealing with them
in separate legislation. They are called the <i>am&ecirc;lu</i>, the <i>mushk&ecirc;nu</i>,
and the <i>wardu</i>. Etymology, analogy with other society, and above
all an attentive consideration of their treatment in the Code have
made their meaning clear. But almost every attempt to translate
these words has failed to convey exactly the true position.</p>

<p>The <i>am&ecirc;lu</i> was evidently a man of the predominant class, the
aristocracy, probably men of the conquering race, Amorites and those
admitted by intermarriage, adoption, or other custom to the same
status. We may compare their position with that of the Normans in
England.</p>

<p>In the Tell-el-Amarna tablets <i>am&ecirc;lu</i> is still used as an official title,
the word is akin to the early Arabic <i>&#8217;ulu</i>, <i>ulai</i>, and may be rendered
&#8216;noble&#8217;. In accordance with this usage, in Babylonia, the king or
his minister is often addressed in letters of the First Dynasty Period,
in courteous phrase as the <i>am&ecirc;lu sha Marduk uballitsu</i>, or &#8216;the <i>am&ecirc;lu</i>
to whom may Marduk grant life&#8217;. The king was thus regarded as
the First Gentleman of Babylonia. Often <i>am&ecirc;lu</i> has to be rendered
&#8216;official&#8217;. But even in Hammurabi&#8217;s time, it was extended like our
words Sir or Esquire to mark every person of position, not otherwise
titled. It was accorded to many professions, even to craftsmen and
artisans; but was as respectful as our Mr. Dean or Mr. Archdeacon,
survivals of Magister or Master. Even in the Code it might denote
&#8216;a man&#8217; simply, and cover the second grade where the law recognized
no difference of rank or status. When the law says, &#8216;if a man accuse
a man,&#8217; it uses <i>am&ecirc;lu</i> for &#8216;man&#8217;. Hence we may render <i>am&ecirc;lu</i> by
&#8216;gentleman&#8217; when he is contrasted with other grades, but &#8216;man&#8217;
simply when no reference to grade is contemplated.</p>

<p>When on military service, the <i>am&ecirc;lu</i> was an &#8216;officer&#8217;, having
under him smaller or greater bands of commoners, slaves, or
tributaries.</p>

<p>He was often a person of wealth, as well as position and birth, but
might be poor, through misfortune, debt, or misconduct. For the
most part he was of the Amorite stock, though so many bear genuine
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
old Semitic Babylonian names that we may assume that old families
of wealth and position from among the conquered had been admitted
to the ranks of the <i>am&ecirc;lu</i>, doubtless through intermarriage. The
<i>am&ecirc;lu</i> dwelt often in a mansion or palace, literally great house, <i>&ecirc;kallu</i>,
the Hebrew <i>hekal</i>. Such palaces are mentioned as being built for
men who certainly were not kings, nor even princes of royal stock.
Hence, we may observe in passing, the slave of the palace (&sect;&sect; 175-6)
is not necessarily &#8216;slave of the king&#8217;. The city governor usually had
his palace or mansion.</p>

<p>We may conveniently render <i>am&ecirc;lu</i> by &#8216;patrician&#8217;; and even
without implying all that that term would mean in ancient Rome,
we see traces of a close analogy in the way in which foreigners
attached themselves to the family of the <i>am&ecirc;lu</i> to obtain privileges of
citizenship.</p>

<p>The class which has given most trouble to realize was called the
<i>mushk&ecirc;nu</i>. <span class="smcap">Professor Scheil</span>, followed by <span class="smcap">Dareste</span>, <i>Journal des
Savans</i>, rendered the ideographic signs used in the Code, <span class="smcap">Mash-en-kak</span>,
by &#8216;noble&#8217;, not recognizing the Babylonian rendering first
pointed out in print by <span class="smcap">Professor Zimmern</span><a name="FNanchor_14_12" id="FNanchor_14_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_12" class="fnanchor">14</a> as <i>mushk&ecirc;nu</i>,
but already known to me and underlying my first translations.
The word <i>mushk&ecirc;nu</i> passed into Hebrew as <i>misk&ecirc;n</i>, and later
into modern languages&mdash;Italian <i>meschino</i>, <i>meschinello</i>, Portuguese
<i>mesquinho</i>, French <i>mesquin</i>&mdash;naturally, with modifications of meaning.
Its derivation suggests the meaning of &#8216;suppliant&#8217;, from
<i>k&acirc;nu</i>, &#8216;to bow,&#8217; and points to a position of inferiority, if not
dependence. It had already been recognized that he was less fined
for misdeeds, which evidently suggested the rendering &#8216;noble&#8217;. But
as it turns out, Hammurabi was more severe in his punishment of the
aristocracy than of the poorer or inferior class. On the other hand,
while the proud patrician insisted on exact retaliation for his injuries,
&#8216;eye for eye&#8217;, &#8216;tooth for tooth&#8217;, &#8216;limb for limb&#8217;, the <i>mushk&ecirc;nu&#8217;s</i>
injuries were assessed for pecuniary compensation. He was expected
to accept a less primitive award, pointing to a more civilized state.
The difference in treatment suggests difference of race. They may
well have been the subject race, common people without rights of
citizenship. There was a quarter in Sippara, the <i>mushk&ecirc;nutu</i>, where
this people dwelt apart from the houses, with their gardens and broad
streets, occupied by the patricians. This also points in the same
direction. We know that the guilds each occupied its own quarter,
as in many mediaeval cities, but these had already won, or never lost,
the right to rank as <i>am&ecirc;lu</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>mushk&ecirc;nu</i> was not necessarily poor, for (&sect; 15) he had slaves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
and goods. The earliest copy of the Code sometimes gives <i>am&ecirc;lu</i>
where the later reads <i>mushk&ecirc;nu</i>. <span class="smcap">M&uuml;ller</span> had called him an
<i>Armenstiftler</i>, but there is no trace of his receiving a pension.
<span class="smcap">Kohler</span>, <span class="smcap">Peiser</span>, and <span class="smcap">Ungnad</span> call him <i>Ministerial</i>, but adduce
no evidence that he had any special relation to government or clergy.
<span class="smcap">Hommel</span> thought him a dependant of the priests, comparing the
Hebrew Cohen.</p>

<p>The word, as <span class="smcap">Mr. Combe</span> has shown in <i>Babyloniaca</i>,<a name="FNanchor_15_13" id="FNanchor_15_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_13" class="fnanchor">15</a> is found in
Arabic&mdash;<i>mas&acirc;k&icirc;n</i>, used of those who are not <i>s&acirc;d&egrave;h</i> (plural <i>sayyid</i>)
descendants of the Prophet; nor <i>mashayikh</i>, &#8216;nobles&#8217;, affiliated to
the family of the Prophet; nor <i>gab&acirc;yil</i>, &#8216;secular nobles&#8217;; but
including the &#8216;labourers&#8217;, &#8216;workers&#8217;, &#8216;merchants&#8217;, &#8216;schoolmasters&#8217;,
&#8216;sycophants&#8217;, and &#8216;mendicants&#8217;. They are unable to carry arms,
have no organization, and are entirely under the domination of the
nobles. They cannot in any case change their condition. This
seems to have been their exact position in ancient Babylonia also, at
any rate in somewhat later times.</p>

<p>The <i>mushk&ecirc;nu</i> may have descended to a lower position in Babylon,
for the phrase, <i>ana mushk&ecirc;n&ucirc;ti al&acirc;ku</i>, meant &#8216;to go to misery&#8217;, &#8216;to
be ruined&#8217;. We may even note steps in this degradation. In the
Tell-el-Amarna tablets, Amenophis king of Egypt answers the letter
of Kadashman-Ellil, the Kassite king of Babylon, who had inquired
after his daughter the princess Tsukhartu, one of the Egyptian
king&#8217;s matrimonial alliances. The Babylonian king says that
Amenophis had had his sister to wife, but no messenger of his had
ever been able to converse with that princess, or to know whether she
was alive or dead. They had indeed seen a certain lady, but whether
she was the daughter of some <i>mushk&ecirc;nu</i> they could not tell. They
hardly suspected her of being a poor man&#8217;s daughter, only of being
a &#8216;commoner&#8217;. So too, in the days when Babylonia was subject
to Assyria, the Babylonians complained that they were being treated
as <i>mushk&ecirc;nu</i>, not surely as poor men merely, for the obvious answer
would be to increase their taxes, but as inferiors subject to
indignities.</p>

<p>At any rate, in Hammurabi&#8217;s Code they are free and possess
moderate means, but are inferior persons to the <i>am&ecirc;lu</i>, yet superior
to the slave.</p>

<p>We see that these poor men fell later into still more abject conditions.
In the later texts it is usually their weakness, helplessness,
and poverty that is dwelt upon.<a name="FNanchor_16_14" id="FNanchor_16_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_14" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>Hence my first rendering was &#8216;poor-man&#8217;, but later I preferred
to use &#8216;plebeian&#8217;, to which view most scholars have now come round.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>The slave, <i>wardu</i>, was often spoken of as &#8216;a head&#8217;, as if he were
a chattel, or a mere animal. He was perpetually changing hands,
being sold or pledged (&sect;&sect; 118, 147). Any damage done to him had
to be paid for, but the compensation went to his master (&sect;&sect; 213, 214,
219, 220). If he repudiated his master&#8217;s rights to his service, he was
punished by mutilation. It appears that his master had no power to
kill him, but he could brand him and put fetters on him. Yet the
slave could acquire wealth and often acted in business as a free man,
but his master had control of his actions and took a share of his
profits. If he was living in his master&#8217;s house, he could not buy
or sell except by written authority from his master (&sect; 7). Many
slaves, however, married and had homes of their own. The master
might act as patron and recover debts for them. Presumably they
could not plead in Court, though they were called on to bear
witness.</p>

<p>A slave, who married one of his master&#8217;s slave girls, or for whom,
as often was the case, a master bought a slave girl to be wife, was
usually provided with a house to live in and often with furniture,
such as would not disgrace a freeman&#8217;s home. Here he lived as
a simple poor worker. His master usually respected his rights,
fed him and clothed him in return for his service and treated him as
a poor subject brother. When the master thus set up a slave for life,
with wife, house, and home, he often laid it down that the slave should
clothe and feed himself henceforth, and specified the extent of service
which he would demand. Clearly such was a very modified slavery.
Slaves do not seem to have often been retained living in the house
long after they grew up to manhood. On the other hand, slave girls
and women were kept in the master&#8217;s house. A master often made
a slave girl mother of his children. But if so, these children were
not born to slavery, but if acknowledged became legitimate heirs to
the master&#8217;s estate, and if not, were at least free, and the slave
mother was freed when the master died. There is no suggestion that
a Babylonian master claimed any rights over the slave wife of his
slave, beyond some share in such work as weaving and perhaps a few
household duties.</p>

<p>The slave who lived in his own house, if active and industrious,
might soon acquire wealth, or he might inherit it from relatives.
Hence, he might aspire to marry a free woman. In that case, if he
remained a slave, his master took one half his property at death and
the other half went to his free wife and her children who also were
free. Such a free wife of one who was still a slave might bring her
marriage portion, inherit property, &amp;c. In fact she forfeited none of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the rights of a free woman by marrying a slave man. Doubtless, in
many cases a master preferred his slave marrying a free woman
to having to purchase a slave girl for him. He had to weigh the
reversion of one half his slave&#8217;s acquired property against the value of
a family of born slaves, who of course had to be fed and clothed till
they were of value for sale or service. The humane Babylonians
were strongly averse to separating a slave mother from her children
and they were usually sold in families.</p>

<p>The slave who did acquire wealth often bought his own freedom.
The master had to balance the value to him of the ransom paid
against the reversion of his entire property at his death. In such
a case, of course, the master fixed the price he would accept as
a ransom. The slave, however, if married to a slave wife would have
to buy her freedom also, and buy each of his slave children if he had
any. The prudent slave, therefore, married a free woman. The
slave who thus acquired freedom, if a foreigner, might return to his
own land, or join the ranks of the poor men who were free. He
would thus become a <i>mushk&ecirc;nu</i>. This and similar considerations
have led several scholars to translate <i>mushk&ecirc;nu</i> by &#8216;freedman&#8217;.
But a freedman is not necessarily a slave who has bought his freedom,
but solely one who has been freed. The distinction is essential
because slaves were often freed for other reasons.</p>

<p>A large number of slaves were freed by adoption into the ranks of
the <i>am&ecirc;lu</i>. A Babylonian father usually portioned off his sons and
daughters on their marriage. The sons, later, at his death, also
shared what he had left. Daughters had no further share. As long
as the father lived, if he fell into poverty or weak health his sons and
daughters naturally were supposed to maintain and care for him.
But they might agree that he should adopt a new son or daughter, to
whom he would leave his residual estate, in return for maintenance
and care as long as he lived. We have spoken of a father, but
<i>mutatis mutandis</i> a mother could do likewise. Some scholars think
that most of the cases of adoption known to us are examples of
a father adopting his natural sons by slave girls. But the adoption
is usually accompanied by a ceremony of purification, symbolizing the
emancipation from the taint of slavery. This would not be necessary
in the case of a natural son of a patrician father. He was free any
way at his father&#8217;s death, even if not acknowledged as heir. Now in
all these cases of adoption of a child to care for one&#8217;s old age, we can
presume that the adoptive parent is childless, as in the frequent cases
of adoption by votaries, or else bereft of children by agreement with
the grown-up family, who willingly resigned their reversion to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
parent&#8217;s estate in exchange for freedom from the care of their aged
parent. In some cases, the adoptive parents, hitherto childless,
adopt a child with the proviso that if hereafter they do have begotten
children, the present adopted one should rank as eldest son or daughter
of the family. Many children were also adopted with the consent of
their real parents, who were usually paid. This in some respects was
a sale by free parents of their children. They had the right to sell
a child to be a slave, but this was a sale to be son or daughter in
freedom and was often a wise provision for that child&#8217;s future on the
part of needy parents.</p>

<p>The distinctive character of the slave is that he is fatherless
by status. It is usual in legal documents to name the father and
often the grandfather of the free contracting parties, the witnesses,
judges, scribes, &amp;c. No slave, unless we reckon as such a freeman
temporarily reduced to slavery, is ever given as son of So-and-so. In
fact, &#8216;the sons of fathers&#8217;, <i>m&acirc;r ban&ucirc;tu</i>, such as were the <i>am&ecirc;lu</i> and
<i>mushk&ecirc;nu</i>, are very clearly men of birth. Their birth, marriage, and
death were registered and recorded, so that it was easy to trace
family descent for many generations. Enough documents are still
preserved to us to compile some family trees for a hundred years
or more. But a slave was without family. He was even forbidden
in some cases to inquire into his real descent. The family honour
was very strictly guarded.</p>

<p>But though occupying so low a grade of society, we have seen that
slaves could rise not only to freedom but become adopted into the
patrician ranks. This privilege might be forfeited and the slave
might be again enslaved without hope of emancipation. There was
a mark of the slave which was put upon him by a <i>gallabu</i>, the barber
and surgeon. Some maintain that this mark was a shaving of the
head or forelock in a peculiar way. The slave would thus betray his
condition, much as a convict does. But this would be soon outgrown
and the slave mark was sometimes an irradicable mark; it is referred
to as on the arm, and the surgeon could remove it. So some rather
think of a tattooed mark. A barber might be induced by a fraudulent
possessor of a slave to remove his old slave mark, but if he could
be shown to have done this wittingly he lost his hands. If he could
prove his innocence of collusion he was released on oath, but the
fraudulent owner was treated as a slave-stealer and put to death. If
a slave ran away and was caught, his captor was bound to carry him
back to his owner, and was then rewarded by statute with a payment
of two shekels (&sect; 17). If the captor kept him hidden in his own
house and did not give him to the town crier he was treated as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
a slave-stealer and put to death (&sect; 15). If the slave broke away
from his captor, the latter had to swear to his non-complicity in the
escape and was then free of blame. The slave was not kept in confinement
as a rule; he might freely go about the city, and was usually
completely trusted to do errands, but he could not leave the city
without his master&#8217;s consent. If a fugitive slave was captured and
would not name his master, he was to be taken to the palace or
governor&#8217;s house and there put to the question, and if possible
restored to his owner. If such could not be found, the slave was
added to the public slaves, available for the <i>corv&eacute;e</i>. Harbouring
a fugitive slave was punished with death. The slave when recovered
by his master might be put in chains.</p>

<p>The slave ranks were recruited principally by captives taken in war.
But there was regular slave trading. A great many slaves were
bought of dealers. After a great battle many prisoners were sold
publicly. It is interesting to note that the Code contemplates slave
dealers often offering for sale in Babylonia slaves whom they had
bought abroad. Such might include slaves captured, stolen, or fled
from Babylonia, and even Babylonians themselves. If a Babylonian
recognized his lost slave offered for sale the law insisted that the dealer
should take just what he had paid for the slave abroad. He had
to state this price on oath. On the other hand, a Babylonian captive
bought abroad and offered for sale in Babylonia was to be set free.
So a slave merchant made no profit on any one who had once been
in Babylonia before, scarcely an encouragement to rescue Babylonians
by buying them in foreign lands. But the slave dealer was sure
of his price for both. For the feudal tenant who had to perform
military service, and therefore was most likely to be captured abroad,
was to be ransomed whenever possible by his own family, if not
by the local treasury, the temple; if that was too impoverished,
he would be ransomed by the State (&sect; 32).</p>

<p>Of course, a very large part of Hammurabi&#8217;s Code, as may be
expected, deals with matters which primarily concerned the state
of society in Babylonia in his day. Much of this was quite unlike
the state of society for which the Laws of Moses were promulgated.
Deeply interesting as such sections are for the early history of human
institutions, we must set them aside if we are to confine our
investigations within reasonable limits. Suffice it now to repeat the
opinion that the Code is one of the most important documents ever
recovered to elucidate ancient history. For this contribution to
knowledge the histories of Babylonia may be consulted, for its
contribution to the study of ancient law the works of <span class="smcap">Professor</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Kohler</span> and <span class="smcap">Professor Schorr</span>, and their bibliographies are most
valuable.</p>

<p>It is, however, clear that the Code did not aim at legislating
for everything that could occur. It says nothing about murder.
That was evidently left to be dealt with by well-established custom.
Only it interferes to protect the man, who in a quarrel and evidently
in danger of his own life should strike a fatal blow. He was allowed
to purge himself by oath that he did not mean to kill. Further
it passes sentence of death on the wife who procures her husband&#8217;s
death for love of another man.</p>

<p>What the custom was with respect to deliberate premeditated
murder we do not yet know. But a late text quotes as an immemorial
custom at Babylon that not even a brigand could be put to death
there without trial.</p>

<p>The Code is a digest of customary law, a set of confirmed and
enacted precedents. It is not properly a Code in the sense of the
fully systematized <i>Code civile</i> of France or the German <i>B&uuml;rgerliches
Gesetzbuch</i>.</p>

<h2>LECTURE II</h2>

<p>In my first lecture I tried to set out in brief some of the most
striking features of the Babylonian Code of Laws due to the famous
king Hammurabi, especially such as were likely to be useful for our
comparison with the laws of Israel. We must, however, have a precise
idea of the laws of Israel before we can institute a comparison.</p>

<p>Now this is by no means so easy to obtain as one might expect.
It is indeed true that the laws of the Hebrew peoples, as set out in
the so-called Books of Moses, have been the subject of uninterrupted
and intense study by the Jews themselves for many centuries, and
that not only for their antiquarian interest but as of supreme importance
for religion and morals in the life of to-day. Most of us have
heard of the Rabbinic writings, of the Mishna and Gemara, of the
Talmud, and may even know the names of some of the famous
Rabbis, lawyers, and doctors who have commented upon them. But,
I fear, few of us have any clear idea of the stupendous work which
they represent. Perhaps the new Jewish Encyclopaedia may give us
a better idea. Christian scholars, such as the famous Dr. John
Lightfoot, made much use of the treasures of the Jewish writers, but
modern scholars appear to have paid small attention to this type of
learning.</p>

<p>Nevertheless we are sometimes assured that the discussions of the
Jewish Rabbis embody all the most assured results of modern
criticism. Certainly they do contain an amount of material for the
elucidation of the Mosaic laws which is almost bewildering in extent.
When the traditional information and explanation which they furnish
are freely taken into account we shall doubtless be in a far better
position to understand much that is now very obscure. Certain it is
that some scholars who have made a special study of this large
traditional body of interpretation, such as <span class="smcap">D. H. M&uuml;ller</span>, <span class="smcap">Nathan</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Pick</span>, have been willing to admit most striking likenesses
between the Rabbinic rules and old Babylonian law. In fact, it
seems to be the case that the later Jewish interpretation of the
Mosaic law so closely follows Babylonian law that it may be regarded
as no less a commentary on that legislation. Our task would soon
be at an end if we could be sure that this traditional view was not
strongly influenced by the Jewish exile, but really represented what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the old Jewish law was intended to be. For it is practically indistinguishable
from the Code of Hammurabi except for the peculiar
usages based upon a separate religion and a progressive interpretation
in favour of the criminal due to benevolence and humane sentiment.</p>

<p>Very little more need be said than that the Jews, with their wonderful
adaptability to the customs of the land of their adoption which
has always rendered them the best of citizens, readily assimilated all
that was good in Babylonia while preserving also the best things in
their own ancient law and jealously guarding whatever was sacred
by its religious value. Such a course was not only sane and sensible;
it affords a proof of the great hold which Hammurabi&#8217;s Code still
had in Babylonia at the time of the Exile and much later; it sets the
seal of approval on its regulations as the judgement of some of the
most penetrating intellects the world has seen, and furnishes a brilliant
example of a learned but not pedantic attitude which we may do well
to imitate.</p>

<p>We shall have reason to refer presently to some of the later Jewish
traditions and to appreciate their value.</p>

<p>It is the case that among Christians also the laws of Moses have
been studied with deep interest and increasingly careful scholarship.
Possibly too little attention has been paid by the modern Christian
scholar to ancient tradition. At any rate, the chief part of the
difficulties which we are likely to find in comparing the two legislations
arise from the results of the studies pursued by orthodox modern
Christian, or at any rate non-Jewish, scholars which have been carried
out for the most part without reference to Jewish susceptibilities or
Rabbinic interpretations.</p>

<p>Modern scholarship has succeeded in fixing and separating out of
the Books of Moses a number of different sources or documents. In
the case of the laws these may be regarded as different codes promulgated
at very different dates, or in some cases mere pious wishes for
future observance, ultimately worked up into a loosely combined book
written in the interest of a party of religious zealots whose prominence
later led to the system of thought known to us as Judaism.</p>

<p>We must accept these results, so far as we can get a distinct notion
of them, and refer to the separate codes rather than to a single body
of laws known as those of Moses. No one can venture to dispute
these decisions on pain of being reckoned reactionary and obscurantist.
These scholars hold the seat of authority, and it would be rash presumption
to question their ruling. Nor have I any wish to do this.
Yet it may be hoped that they will pardon a sigh of regret on our
part that we are now unable to compare the Mosaic law as a whole
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
with the Code of Hammurabi. It would be so much easier for the
lecturer, and the indebtedness of Moses to Hammurabi so much
more convincing to you. Sadly as many have lamented the tearing
of the great law-book of Moses into pieces as rendering it a mere
thing of shreds and patches, they may take comfort that its present
condition renders it much harder to recognize the characteristic
texture of the Babylonish garment.</p>

<p>For now, when one fancies he can discern a surprising likeness
between some clause in the Code of Hammurabi and some verse in
the Bible, he is wise to keep his surprise to himself until he has procured
and studied the latest critical subdivision of the laws of Israel
and satisfied himself to which source or sources his verse belongs.
Then one has to ransack other authorities to know whether this ruling
is one which is widely accepted, and even more important, whether it
had been independently reached or was constructed with an eye to
the very likeness to Babylonian law which it dreaded to acknowledge.</p>

<p>Consequently we have to be very careful to-day. We cannot use
our comparisons, even if they should suggest identity, to restore to
more ancient dates the Mosaic items which seem to be most closely
in accord with Hammurabi&#8217;s laws. For here tradition itself imports
many difficulties. If we set Moses the lawgiver at his old place in
history, just before the entrance of the Israelites into Canaan, and
accept the traditional synchronism of Abraham and Amraphel, then
if we accept the modern identification of Amraphel with Hammurabi
we are landed in this difficulty: the Hammurabi Code is thus as
much older than the Mosaic law as Abraham is before Moses. On
the authority of Moses himself that means 430 years. Now the
Babylonians reckoned 650 years from the death of Hammurabi to
the death of Kadashman-Ellil, who was corresponding with
Amenophis King of Egypt while that king was still sovereign of
Palestine, and therefore before Moses. This is the lowest figure yet
suggested based on documentary sources, and gives at least 700
years between the two codes. How can we reconcile the disparity
in dates?</p>

<p>The Higher Critics do not mend matters. They would bring
down the date of the early Mosaic laws much later, necessitating
a period of more than a thousand years between the two codes. It
would take hours to argue out the merits of various systems of
chronology, and the truth probably is that we have not yet recovered
reliable data to fix either Babylonian or Biblical chronology with
sufficient accuracy. Babylonian chronology is, however, in much the
better state, and late rulings make the death of Hammurabi fall
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
somewhere near 1916 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> But how we are to reconcile such a date
for Abraham with the Biblical data is a knotty question to which
I can contribute no help to solution.</p>

<p>We have here made some assumptions which may be all wrong.
I am often asked with much concern whether Hammurabi really is
Amraphel. Now that is a question which cannot possibly be
answered until much else has been answered first. Hammurabi we
know; his life and reign are as well or better known than those of the
Saxon kings of England. But who was Amraphel? All we know
of him is contained in the fourteenth chapter of Genesis. He is there
said to be King of Shinar. If Shinar in that passage means what it
clearly means elsewhere, he was a king of Babylonia, or at least of
some part of that land for which Shinar is used as a synonym. But
even if Shinar does not certainly mean Singara, part of Assyria, it
could quite well be a part of the Mesopotamian area with which the
early Israelites became acquainted, and so transferred its name to all
Babylonia. But Hammurabi is never said to be King of Shinar, nor
of any land but Amurru, Akkad, Elam, &amp;c., or Sumer. The latter
name means South Babylonia, where R&icirc;m-Sin of Larsa maintained
his supremacy in spite of Hammurabi until his thirty-first year. Till
then no one could call Hammurabi King of Sumer, and then it is
certain he could be no ally with R&icirc;m-Sin. Hammurabi was, however,
always King of Babylon. He could hardly have been called King of
Shinar by any one who knew anything about his history.</p>

<p>How comes Hammurabi&#8217;s name to be rendered by Amraphel? We
know that his name was variously rendered in cuneiform, being
a foreign name to the Babylonian scribes. But they never spell his
name as ending in <i>l</i>. It has been suggested that one character which
denotes <i>bi</i> and can also be read <i>bil</i> may have misled some Hebrew
writer who transcribed the cuneiform account which he found among
the archives of some ancient city in Palestine. There is nothing
whatever improbable in such ancient cuneiform records being kept.
The discovery of the Tell-el-Amarna tablets proves that the kings of
Palestine before the Israelite invasion wrote to their neighbours far
and near in cuneiform and in the Babylonian language, and also that
they spoke a language closely related to Hebrew. But there is no
evidence that they misread cuneiform. Let us go on with the
assumptions supposed to have restored the credibility of the fourteenth
chapter of Genesis. The first point has been that, assuming a cuneiform
record to be translated by a Hebrew writer (? Moses) who knew
some cuneiform Babylonian, that writer blundered into misreading
the name of one of the most celebrated kings of Babylon, with whose
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
history he must have been little acquainted and whose name he found
written in a way to which there is no known parallel. Further, he
called him King of Shinar. No tenable suggestion has yet been made
as to what cuneiform signs he rendered by Shinar. There also he
must have found something to which there is no parallel in the native
titles of Hammurabi. There is not a single reason in anything said
of Amraphel to suggest anything properly said of Hammurabi, except
that the names have two out of four letters in common.</p>

<p>But we are told that this identification is supported by the identification
of R&icirc;m-Sin of Larsa with Arioch of Ellasar. R&icirc;m-Sin and
Arioch have only one letter in common, though Larsa and Ellasar
have three. It is a perfect triumph of ingenuity to identify R&icirc;m-Sin
and Arioch, and it has been done on various suppositions.
But it is also clear that on no supposition was a Hebrew right in
reading R&icirc;m-Sin as Arioch, nor has the former name been yet found
written in the form which he has been supposed to have so misread.
The confirmation of one blunder turns out to be the assumption of
another as bad or worse. But the others, Chedorlaomer King of
Elam and Tidal king of &#8216;Nations&#8217;, are also accounted for by a series
of misreadings either in cuneiform or out of it into Hebrew or in
Hebrew. Grant, then, all that is claimed for this astounding blunder-exegesis.
Amraphel was meant for Hammurabi by a man who persistently
misread cuneiform. The cuneiform account being reliable
history, we can reconstruct what it said about Hammurabi and R&icirc;m-Sin
with two somewhat vague allies in Palestine. But what credence
are we to give to this Hebrew writer&#8217;s reading of cuneiform in the
case of the name of Abraham? At what period of Hammurabi&#8217;s
reign was an alliance with his life-long enemy R&icirc;m-Sin likely or even
possible? When did either make an expedition to the West under
the suzerainty of Elam?</p>

<p>But we might consume hours discussing each thread of the web
of fancies which some modern scholars have woven over and about the
fourteenth chapter of Genesis. There is no mention in Babylonian
or Assyrian documents of any one of the persons there named, nor
any event recorded similar to those there placed. This fact neither
confirms nor contradicts the Hebrew narrative. The doubts thrown
on the historicity of the chapter by higher critics were based on
arguments which, sound or not, are in no way touched by any
cuneiform texts.</p>

<p>So our question must be put differently. It should be: Was the
writer of the fourteenth chapter of Genesis of opinion that Abraham
was a contemporary of Hammurabi? I am not sure that he ever
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
heard of Hammurabi or knew who he was. The whole story, if
reliable, may apply to some other kings than those usually supposed,
and this would suit what little we know of chronology much
better. It is precisely the identification of Amraphel with
Hammurabi which professedly rehabilitates the fourteenth chapter
of Genesis, but at the expense of other Biblical statements equally
important. It is always well to distinguish the statements of
archaeologists and Assyriologists on unrelated subjects from the
results of science. No matter how distinguished an Assyriologist
may be, his opinion on other matters than Assyriology cannot be laid
to the charge of that branch of knowledge. The statements made
in the fourteenth chapter of Genesis may yet be shown to be affected
by Assyriological research, but most of the recent speculations about
them deserve neither the name of Archaeology or Assyriology.</p>

<p>The effect of modern criticism is to make us cautious in another
direction. I have hitherto spoken of the Laws of Moses, and I shall
continue to do so throughout my lectures. But I trust you will not
misunderstand my position. To speak of the Laws of Moses is
simply to use the title which was given to them before the rise of
modern criticism and by which they are still most widely known.
It does not necessarily assume that any one ever existed at all like
the Moses described in the Old Testament. Some regard Moses as
the name of a mythical hero&mdash;a national ideal into whose personification
were run all the mythological material which the Hebrew writers
deemed appropriate. This need not be the same thing as to deny
absolutely the personality of Moses; for another great conqueror of
men, Alexander the Great, most assuredly lived, and one clear proof
of it, if we had no other, is that his deeds so impressed men that the
Arabic historians ascribe to him just as many mythical stories as
they know. You have only to read <span class="smcap">A. Jeremias&#8217;s</span> <i>Old Testament in
the Light of the Ancient East</i> to see how almost every incident in
the life of Moses may be paralleled by some astral <i>motif</i> in the
mythical story of other ancient heroes or demigods.</p>

<p>But the effect of modern criticism, astral theory, comparative
mythology, &amp;c., on the history of Moses leave him much like a lump
of sugar in a cup of tea. We know it was there because the tea is
sweet, but details as to size or shape are now very unreliable. Nor
does Assyriology help us much, for it never mentions or refers to
Moses any more than it does to Abraham, or to Israel even until the
days of Shalmaneser, 859-825 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>In speaking of the Laws of Moses then, the use of the word Moses
is not meant to imply any opinion or to prejudice any question as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
to the personality or history of the lawgiver or the date of the law.
It is used solely as a convenient periphrasis for the current Hebrew
lawgiver, just as Hammurabi may be taken as a periphrasis for the
Babylonian legislator. That the Babylonian king originated all or
even any of the laws enacted in his Code is not asserted. But the
historical case of Hammurabi does remove all <i>a priori</i> improbability
that a Hebrew legislator could draw up a code of laws at a much
later date. Further, it should make us beware of arguing anything
from the absence of mention in such documents as have come down
to us, for, until the excavation of his monuments, no one among
modern scholars had guessed his name or surmised his existence.</p>

<p>This analogy, while it forbids us to deny the existence of Moses,
does not show that any or all of the laws ascribed to Moses were
in any sense due to him. But that a leader in the position to which
tradition assigned Moses could perfectly well promulgate a code of
laws as full and complete as the whole Mosaic law, even for a people
in the primitive state of society in which Israel is often supposed to
have been at the Exodus, is obvious. He had only to avail himself
of the knowledge of cuneiform, available at that time both in Canaan
and in Egypt, and import copies of the Hammurabi Code from
Babylonia if they were not at hand where he then was. He could
exercise his judgement as to what would be suitable for his people,
add what he chose, and reject what he disliked. That he did this or
anything like it is not asserted, but it would be so natural for any one
in his position then that we have no excuse for surprise if we should
find indications of his having done exactly that.</p>

<p>Still, nothing depends in our comparison of the Laws of Moses
with the Code of Hammurabi on our knowledge of the personality
or circumstances of Moses. Much would depend on how much of the
Laws of Moses we should consider to be his. In a similar way, the
use of such terms as the Book of the Covenant, Leviticus, or Deuteronomy,
The Priestly Code, and the like, neither implies nor denies the
appropriateness of the terms nor any adhesion to any theory of their
source or date. They must be regarded as merely names for more
or less definite pieces of legislation. That the balance of argument
is in favour of assigning to them the extent usually assigned to
them by Old Testament critics may be granted for purposes of
comparison. It is an opinion which may not be shared by all. But
it is not by any means essential to our comparison that any one of
the views now held about any of them should be final.</p>

<p>Thus it is enough to grant that the Book of the Covenant is the
sole relic of the earliest Hebrew legislation and that the rest may be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
regarded as later development. In that case, however, it is incumbent
on those who hold the theory of this development as an evolution on
native soil to show intelligibly what influenced the particular form
which that development took. Our comparison may suggest that if
this supposed later law be really not of the Exodus period also, and
not a product of the same mind which modified Babylonian law into
the Book of the Covenant, yet its likeness to Babylonian law excludes
the idea of a free uninfluenced development. We may hold further
that early or late Babylonian influence is still there. And we must
account for its persistent influence. On the supposition of its being
later than the Book of the Covenant we may be inclined to hold that
it was adopted, not directly from Babylonia, but from the relics of
pre-Israelite Babylonian influence on Canaanite law.</p>

<p>It may be asked at once&mdash;what do we know of Canaanite law?
Confessedly very little; but so far little attempt has been made to
inquire into the subject. Scholars have been too ready to endorse
the judgement of the old Jewish writers who denounced all Canaanite
usages. As yet no documents of Canaanite production have been
found, unless we include those of near neighbours like the Phoenicians,
Moabites, and Northern Syrians. We may deduce something from
the Old Testament, but that is a hostile source. A certain amount
of information may be collected from the Tell-el-Amarna tablets,
which supply evidence for times before the Israelites entered Canaan.
Much of the law or custom witnessed to by later times may really be
very old. Some scholars of late have argued with great force that
the First Dynasty of Babylon were not only Amorites but came into
Babylonia from Canaan. There were Amorites left in Canaan when
the Israelites settled there. If these were of the same stock, much
that in the Code of Hammurabi marks change from the old settled
Babylonian Semitic law may be due to a Canaanite source. The
subject of the Amorite characteristics, apart from their peculiar
proper names, has as yet received next to no attention. The
researches of Macalister on Palestinian soil will be awaited with
great interest, as he appears to have recognized such distinct
characters about his Amorite finds as to enable him to identify
them as such without hesitation. He will, it is to be hoped, soon
tell us something of their civilization. Gradually, no doubt, we shall
be able to tell what was the exact character of each of the peoples in
Canaan; and in the end the Code of Hammurabi may prove to be
the best witness we have to the Canaanite law.</p>

<p>The Laws of Moses were once, and in some quarters still are,
supposed to be all contemporary with that great national hero and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
lawgiver, and to form a complete body of law imparted to men by
Divine inspiration. The Jewish commentators, however, of old
treated this view with considerable freedom. Modern scholars, who
have devoted two centuries to a critical study of the Pentateuch, have
lately gravitated towards a fairly definite theory implying the existence
of several codes, so to speak, and those of very different dates, all
much later than the time of Moses. As experience shows there is
very little permanence about the critical views, we had best confine
ourselves to the latest presentation. We need not trouble to inquire
into the merits of the earlier critical theories, and may leave their
refutation to the last writer on the subject. We may take two good
examples for our purpose. Mr. <span class="smcap">S. A. Cook</span> in his excellent work
<i>The Laws of Moses and the Code of Hammurabi</i> assumed the critical
view of the Pentateuch as then presented, and made the most successful
defence of the originality of the Mosaic Law yet attempted. It
will be noted that one of the so-called &#8216;destructive&#8217; critics made
a most vigorous defence of the uninfluenced character of the Mosaic
fragments adjudged by that school to be early. Naturally so; for
such critics it is vital to maintain the exclusion of external influence.
There is no criterion of date for them if the orderly continuous
evolution along well-known lines can be supposed to be overwhelmed
by a catastrophic influence from without. The history of the development
being unknown or rejected in favour of a theoretical reconstruction
upon lines evolved out of the supposed results of comparative
law, religion, or the like, it was delightful and easy to build up a purely
imaginary self-consistent view of the order in which ideas developed
or evolved. The consistence of the view impressed its authors as
proof of reality. There was no history to test the reconstruction
by except such as could be brushed aside as unreliable because inconsistent
with the view. But some late things, dated as late upon this
theory, turned out to be a thousand years older than the early ones,
and so the almost forgotten maxim &#8216;what is primitive need not be
old&#8217; had to be revived. For the evidence of the Hammurabi Code
had to be rebutted anyhow.</p>

<p>It is most remarkable that the champions of the traditional view
never seized upon the Code as a weapon to beat the critics with, while
the Rationalists made a good show of learning and even indulged in
argument on the matter. But after the dust of controversy cleared
off it was perceived that the Code was a new fact to be reckoned
with, neither attacked nor minimized nor exploited, but studied and
respected. As it had surprised and even disconcerted the lawyers, so
it had gradually compelled divines to reconsider.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>A work which freely accepts the critical division of the Hebrew
laws is <span class="smcap">Professor C. F. Kent&#8217;s</span> book&mdash;<i>Israel&#8217;s Laws and Legal
Precedents</i> in the <i>Old Testament Student Series</i>. If any modification
of critical views may have been thought necessary as a result of the new
material provided by the Code of Hammurabi, it is here tacitly but
fully allowed for. Further study may be expended on the comparison
and somewhat modified views may have to be taken, but the nature
of the questions involved is clearly and concisely shown in this work.</p>

<p>Were it possible to institute the comparison between the Code of
Hammurabi and the whole Hebrew legislation treated as one indivisible
body of laws, it would be much less difficult than when a set of
regulations are picked out as early and treated as the only rules
which deserve to be regarded as in the remotest sense Mosaic, while
all else is treated as later and scarcely to be regarded as law
at all, but merely pious wishes or aspirations. By such a careful
selection there is not only very little to compare, but the very things
ruled out as late or unhistorical aspiration on account of their
relatively high tone are just those most like the Babylonian. On such
principles with criteria so carefully selected to rule out all disagreeing
evidence a verdict is easy to attain. It is the fact that these criteria
were invented before the Code of Hammurabi was dreamt of, but it
does afford a very strong test of them and should lead to some
revision. The critical theory is now so firmly rooted in the minds of
all scholars who are not allowed in youth to imagine any alternative
that we too must accept it or be lost in a perfect morass of unintelligibility.
Only we ought to remember that in so doing we make the
comparison as difficult and complicated as possible.</p>

<p>Accepting the present division of the Hebrew laws it is possible to
divide the periods of Babylonian influence on Israel correspondingly.
The conclusion to be drawn is that Babylonian influence was strong
in the case of the earliest Israelite law perhaps through common
Semitic custom, recalling that Abraham traditionally came from Ur
of the Chaldees through Haran, a Babylonian Province, to settle
there under strong Babylonian influence where Babylonian language
and writing were still used down to the time of the Exodus. The
impression of Babylonian is said to be less prominent in later codes
until after the Assyrians, whose civilization was specifically of Babylonian
origin and type, had held Palestine vassal for two centuries.
The Exile was to Babylon itself, and Babylonian influence is naturally
strongest after the Return from the Exile, and even more powerful
on the Jewish doctors of later days, many of whom continued to live
in Babylonia.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>Seeing, however, that there is not yet full and final acceptance of
critical views as to the exact classification of the Hebrew laws into
separate codes, and that my audience is probably not completely
familiar with either the separate codes in themselves or their dates,
anything like a complete comparison of the Laws of Moses with the
Code of Hammurabi is impossible without first at least sketching the
character of each separate code. For comparative purposes we may
begin with the earliest and see how it compares with Babylonian law,
for the rest what has already been compared need not be repeated,
but as it is necessary to limit our time I must leave all critical
reasons for assigning a passage to a particular stratum to be consulted
in <span class="smcap">Professor Kent&#8217;s</span> volume and the extended literature
which he names.</p>

<p>The usually accepted critical views of the sources of the Pentateuch
regard the Book of the Covenant as the oldest code of Hebrew law
now preserved to us. What law the people obeyed before we are not
told, but it is obvious that they were not without law. Some scholars,
attaching great weight to the traditions of the patriarchs and the
implications of their story as to the growth of the people of Israel,
assume that before the adoption of the Book of the Covenant they
were nomad pastoral folk, and obeyed much the same customs as the
Bedawin Arabs of the present day. For such a standpoint the late
<span class="smcap">Professor W. Robertson Smith&#8217;s</span> works on Semitic civilization,
religion, and law are simply indispensable. Here, if anywhere, we
can find a clear idea of common Semitic custom, so often appealed to
to account for the similarities between Jewish law and the Hammurabi
Code. But other scholars look on these narratives of the patriarchal
life with deep suspicion as being a late attempt to sketch, in the light
of a writer&#8217;s knowledge of what the nomads of his day were like, an
instructive and edifying ancestral background for a set of very dissimilar
tribes or clans, whom some political necessity led to amalgamate
into the Hebrew people. A great deal in our research naturally
depends upon our attitude to the questions, &#8216;Was Israel ever in Egypt?&#8217;
or &#8216;Was only one party of them ever there?&#8217; Or again, &#8216;Was the
Book of the Covenant promulgated at the unification of the component
clans, or did it grow up long after?&#8217; All such and many
similar questions we must lay aside, as we start with the Book of the
Covenant as accepted Israelite law.</p>

<p>We cannot suppose the Book of the Covenant preserved in its
original state. Even if we suppose it was promulgated solely to
decide those cases on which conflicting usage was causing disturbance,
say between nomad Israelites settling down and the long settled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Canaanite town dwellers; no one can be prepared to claim that it is
complete. There must have been more of it. What we have now
preserved may have been cut down to present limits for various
reasons. It may be that later legislation superseded some of its
regulations which later writers would thus think not worth recording.
If the Code had been embodied in a document, that source may have
become fragmentary in some way by the time the compiler of
Exodus rescued it from oblivion. A careful perusal of the laws of
Moses as arranged in their strata, by <span class="smcap">Professor Kent</span> for example,
will show that Hebrew writers had no hesitation in repeating earlier
legislation. Hence we cannot argue that no more was preserved
solely because it was embodied in later legislation.</p>

<p>Nor can we feel sure that no additions have been made to it.
Some clauses seem to be very incongruous in their present context.
This phenomenon, however, is not entirely absent from the Code of
Hammurabi, which certainly has not been interpolated. But we must
start on the Book of the Covenant, as critics have rescued it from its
surroundings and set it down for us.</p>

<p>At once an external feature strikes us. In the Book of the Covenant
many have discerned a systematic arrangement of the laws in pentads
or decads. The Ten Commandments at once occur to one&#8217;s mind as
a parallel. What is the significance of this partiality for five and
ten? We are expressly told that the Ten Commandments were on
two tables. We should not be surprised had there been seven.
Some will think the human equipment of five fingers led to the
adoption of five as a convenient method of remembrance. In some
such way five or ten may have conveyed the idea of numerical completeness.
Unfortunately the division of the laws made by <span class="smcap">Professor
V. Scheil</span> in his <i>editio princeps</i> of the Code is both arbitrary and
inaccurate. No one has yet ventured to revise the numbering of the
sections into which he divided the text of the Code; though several
scholars have pointed out the inconsistencies. The lecturer, however,
was struck by the fact that a more natural division at once shows an
arrangement in <i>pentads</i>; and lately <span class="smcap">Professor D. G. Lyon</span> has
worked out this idea, as can be most conveniently followed in the
rendering of the Code given by <span class="smcap">Professor R. W. Rogers</span> in his
<i>Cuneiform Parallels to the Old Testament</i>. Such an attempt will be
resented by some as a purely subjective attempt to work up a likeness
to the Mosaic laws and disputed accordingly. But the lecturer was
led to it in the beginning solely by the fact that <span class="smcap">Scheil</span>&#8217;s division
did not agree with that made by the Babylonian scribes in the fragments
of their copies which have survived. These divisions had no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
justification on the stela found at Susa, which divides only lines and
even occasionally cuts a word in two. It shows no indication where
a particular law begins or ends. Hence the Babylonian scribes, as
all modern scholars, have had to divide as their common sense dictated.
But the text on the stela was certainly copied from a clay tablet which
may well have shown division-lines between the laws. At any rate, the
divisions adopted by the Babylonian scribes, even if not original, have
great weight as embodying an independent tradition among scholars
who surely knew the meaning and connexion of the successive regulations
in a very authoritative way. That their ruling does not agree
with <span class="smcap">Professor Scheil</span>&#8217;s where we can compare them shows that his
division is not essential and may be neglected. Unfortunately our
fragments of later copies do not help us often, and are too few to give
us a canon upon which we can rely when we need it most, and we
can rarely be sure that the division we propose was that of the
original. Nevertheless there is great verisimilitude about <span class="smcap">Professor
Lyon</span>&#8217;s proposals, and it is a very striking likeness between the Book
of the Covenant and the Code of Hammurabi that both adopted
a division of laws into groups of five. We cannot press the argument
too far, but the Roman Law at any rate shows that this arrangement
is not a logical necessity nor a psychological demand of early
legislation.</p>

<p>The critical account usually given of the Book of the Covenant is
that it embodies the consuetudinary law of the early monarchy. It
is regarded as embracing the formulated decisions which had gradually
accumulated among the people up to that age. It is admitted that it,
or at any rate parts of it, may well be older than the narrative (E.) in
which it was incorporated. Its place in the scale of civilization is
estimated by the fact that it imposes many restrictions on the arbitrary
action of the individual, while it retains the <i>lex talionis</i>. Further,
prominence is sometimes given to the fact that God is regarded as
the immediate source of punishment. It is styled theocratic law,
but breaks away from the purest type of such laws. The Code of
Hammurabi goes further in the direction of purely civil enactment.</p>

<p>The picture which <span class="smcap">W. Robertson Smith</span> draws of the state
of society contemplated by the Book of the Covenant is founded
on the assumption that there was no more of it. The basis of life is
agriculture, cattle and agricultural produce constitute the chief part
of wealth, and the laws of property deal almost exclusively with them.
Only we cannot say that this was all. True, there is no longer preserved
any regulation of the relations between principal and agent,
if such ever existed. There is no widely extended tariff of wages for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
artificers and workpeople. Too much cannot be made of the fact
that the Code of Hammurabi proves the existence of such specialized
classes in Babylonia. For it does so without ever mentioning them in
just those laws which can best be compared with the Book of the
Covenant. If we were acquainted only with that part of the Code of
Hammurabi which does correspond to the Book of the Covenant we
might similarly construct from it a picture of the state of society in
Babylonia just as simple as the Book of the Covenant warrants us in
recognizing in Israel. Nevertheless it was not so.</p>

<p>The fact is that the Book of the Covenant does not present a complete
picture of the state of society in Israel in the early days of the
monarchy. That may not have been so advanced as in the days
of Hammurabi. But the kings of Israel at any rate had need of
skilled workmen. We read, indeed, that Solomon had to send to
Hiram of Tyre for certain workmen, but this is not enough to prove
the entire absence from his dominions of other classes of artisans.
The absence of blacksmiths in Saul&#8217;s time is ascribed to an exceptional
cause. In fact, the only way in which the entire absence in Israel of
all but agriculturalists and shepherds could possibly be accounted for
is by supposing that the Israelites had killed out all the Canaanites.
We know they did not. We may point out other ways in which it
would be dangerous to deduce from the absence of mention in the
Book of the Covenant the non-existence of any particular institution
whatever.</p>

<p>It is of more importance to notice that the principles of criminal
and civil justice are those still current among the Arabs of the
desert, namely, retaliation and money compensation. It is precisely
the same with the Code of Hammurabi. If these features in the
Book of the Covenant compel us to consider the Israelites for whom
it was compiled as nomads in much the same state of civilization
as the Bedawin, the same features compel us in the case of the
Code to ascribe similar civilization to the Babylonians of Hammurabi&#8217;s
period. The fact probably is that in both cases the dominant
folk, Amorites or Hebrews, really were conservative of customs once
in place in the desert if not too unsuitable for a settled life to
retain.</p>

<p>It is a truer way to present the facts to say that both the Book of
the Covenant and the Code of Hammurabi do not so much enact the
<i>lex talionis</i> as interfere to limit its action in certain directions.
For example, it is scarcely correct to say in either case that murder
was dealt with by the law of revenge or left to the avenger of
blood to punish. In the Code murder in general is not mentioned;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
we cannot suppose it condoned. But as in the Book of the Covenant
it is distinguished from manslaughter, and this is expressly exempted
from the death penalty. The innocent man-slayer might take refuge
at the altar, as was still the case with those who feared for their lives
down to the time of Solomon. It is clear that a murderer might do
the same, for he was to be taken thence. Some sort of trial must
have taken place before he was delivered up to the avenger of blood.
We are nowhere told what was the procedure in Babylonia, but we
may assume it was the same, for the innocent man-slayer was liberated
on oath of want of malice. The oath was taken at the altar or before
the emblem of the god. It is singular enough that no penalty
for murder is stated, but there is nothing whatever to indicate that it
met with different treatment in Israel and Babylonia.</p>

<p>In both legislations man-stealing is reckoned with murder and
punished by death. So is witchcraft, according to the evident
implications of the Code and the express declaration of the Book of
the Covenant. That offences against parental authority were treated
differently is to some extent true. They are summarily dealt with in
the Book of the Covenant with a death penalty. The Code spares
the son for a first offence in such crimes as would naturally disinherit
him, and enacts mutilation for violence to a parent. One
may question whether death or loss of the hands was the worse
penalty in Babylonia, and may remember that some critics hesitate
to ascribe the law enacting the death penalty to the Book of the
Covenant. The fierce resentment of the sons of the desert against
any form of mutilation would account for the substitution of the
death penalty. Other cases of injury in the Book of the Covenant
are treated as proper occasions for self-help or for private suits to
be adjusted at the sanctuary. That is exactly the view taken by
Hammurabi, only explicit provision is made for suits which cannot
be so adjusted by judges. Contemporary legal practice bears witness
to frequent settlements &#8216;out of court&#8217;.</p>

<p>The case of the goring ox is treated by both legislations. Both
make no amends to the victim of the attack made by an animal
suddenly become savage. Here the Hebrew Code orders the death of
the ox, a piece of useless barbaric revenge that has only recently died
out amongst us. The poor beast got no trial and could not plead, but
was held responsible. This may be very human, but it is to the credit
of Hammurabi that he is at least silent on the point. On the other
hand, if the ox was known by his owner to be vicious and death
resulted, the Code inflicted stated fines on the owner according to
the estimated value of the life destroyed. The Book of the Covenant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
does the same, fixing a ransom for the death of a slave to
be paid to the owner, but death of the ox&#8217;s owner if the man killed
be a freeman. And again, the ox is killed. The difference between
the two fines for the death of a slave is noteworthy as probably
marking average value in each case. This illustrates the reason
why other fixed money payments do not correspond. Money values
differed. Otherwise the treatments could scarcely be more closely
alike.</p>

<p>In the case of specific and particular bodily injuries both laws
exact a retaliation. The Book of the Covenant is here the more
explicit: &#8216;life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, burning for burning,
wound for wound, stripe for stripe&#8217; is more detailed at any rate
than the Code, which only enumerated &#8216;eye for eye, limb for limb,
tooth for tooth&#8217;. The difference, such as it is, can hardly be pressed
as really giving a different complexion to the legislation. On the
whole, despite its extra detail, the Hebrew law is less clear, and the
arrangement certainly looks like a hasty compilation. For as it stands
these words occur attached to the case of a woman with child hurt by
blows. At any rate Exodus xxi. 24-5 introduces them with the
words &#8216;and if any mischief follow&#8217;. It may be, as some suggest, that
they have slipped in here from some other context, or be merely
an expansion of the ordinary &#8216;eye for eye&#8217; to give a fuller formulation
of the <i>lex talionis</i>. But it is difficult to see how the loss of
a limb, or an eye, or a burning could be the mischief done by a blow
to a pregnant woman. Miscarriage or death, or both, are the mischiefs
likely to happen. The Code of Hammurabi deals with the case more
reasonably. In fact, as it stands, the Exodus passage, xxi. 18-25,
looks very like a loose summary of Hammurabi (&sect;&sect; 196-200) without
its logical connexion. At any rate, it is hardly credible that this
collection of words was ever put forward at any time in the world&#8217;s
history to enunciate a new law for a community of any type that ever
existed. The most intelligible way of regarding this clause is as an
attempt fully to enunciate the law of retaliation, and that its presence
in its present place is due to the desire to explain some phrase which
less effectively quoted that law; but in the quotation of the fuller
statement the fact was overlooked that some of its clauses were
unsuited to the cases under consideration. It is no excuse to say
that it looked back over all the preceding cases of assault, for &#8216;burning&#8217;
nowhere applies. The only clause which really applies is the
first, &#8216;life for life&#8217;.</p>

<p>Doubtless some critical rearrangement may be made to justify the
use of the clauses somewhere, but as it stands it looks like a stupid
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
interpolation or an undiscerning quotation of the law of retaliation
bringing in the sense &#8216;if any mischief follow then it shall come under
the law of retaliation&#8217;. That would yield some sense if interpreted
with common sense in particular cases. The Code of Hammurabi is
much more distinct. If miscarriage followed, a fine was set down.
If the woman died also, the assailants daughter was put to death
when the dead woman was of patrician family, otherwise a fine was
set down. The Book of the Covenant evidently held to the strict
retaliation throughout, but gave no hint as to how it was to be
carried out. The Code slips into the same vagueness if the assailant
had no daughter to pay the penalty of her father&#8217;s fault.</p>

<p>In the case of the injured woman in Exodus xxi. 22, the punishment,
if no mischief follow, was left to be assessed by her husband,
obviously for motives of delicacy; but the decision of the amount to
be paid lay finally with the judges. In Hammurabi&#8217;s Code it was
fixed by statute and graded according to the status of the woman
(&sect;&sect; 209-14). What, we may ask, is the essential difference? Can
any one suppose that in Israel the husband could demand and secure
what compensation he chose? Surely the Hebrew law is a concise
way of saying the same thing as Hammurabi&#8217;s Code does. The
scale of payment could hardly be expected to be the same in both
lands owing to the difference in money values. A discretionary
power in the judges, or a liberty of composition between the parties,
is implied in the Code which everywhere states maximum penalties.
This is made clear by contemporary practice. Both legislations
further take into account the possible death of the woman herself.
Else, what is the meaning of the phrase &#8216;and if mischief follow&#8217;?
The Hebrew law, however, in that case legislates most awkwardly
for what could hardly happen in its endeavour exhaustively to express
the law of retaliation which was to rule the case.</p>

<p>While we are comparing the laws as to assaults and their penalties,
we may pause to note one conspicuous difference between the legislations.
The Babylonian lawgiver made a considerable allowance for
class distinctions. His was eminently class legislation. Some at
once feel that this fact places his law on a lower level than the law of
God. Such is a grotesque misapprehension. In Babylonia there
was what we have not yet attained nor can do until the State bears all
law expenses and gives a poor man justice free of cost. There was
one and the same law for both rich and poor. But the aristocrat was
treated differently from the commoner. In the eyes of some this is
a far worse crime than favouring the rich against the poor, which
is the vice of all democracy. But Hammurabi was in this much
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
finer than we might expect, for he treated the aristocrat more
severely in every respect than the man of humble birth. I do not
attempt to defend that method, but it does need a little explanation.</p>

<p>The facts are these, the aristocrat in Babylonia took a very high
view of his personal dignity as one of the conquering race. On his
continued support and loyalty the safety of the throne, and consequently
the welfare of all Babylonia, depended. The commercial-minded
Babylonians, rich or poor, like any other commercial group in
the history of the world, could never defend for long even their own
money-bags, and for all their industry, brains, and wealth could only
pay for protection so long as the pay they were willing to offer
exceeded the spoil their mercenaries could wring from them. The
aristocrat was actually of a lower civilization, as conquerors were
always apt to be, but he held the land by force of arms. Hammurabi
was as dependent on his noble Amorites as William the Conqueror
was on his Normans. He held them to his allegiance in practically
the same feudal manner as did William and his successors hold
the Barons.</p>

<p>Now the aristocratic <i>am&ecirc;lu</i> or patrician of Babylonia was very
sensitive to a personal injury. He would accept no compensation
for a blow as might a commercial plebeian. The exact retaliation
&#8217;eye for eye, tooth for tooth, limb for limb&#8217; was his sole satisfaction.
The <i>mushk&ecirc;nu</i> or commoner had to be content with a money
payment. So far for the contemporary public opinion. We say
that the proud patrician was conservative of a more primitive type
of law, which we find to be that of a nomad Semitic folk, the
Bedawin Arabs, still. So far as the Hebrew clung to the same law
we discern aristocratic views with a lower type of civilization.</p>

<p>But there is no trace of such class distinctions in the Book of the
Covenant. It is not, therefore, a higher type of law. It would be
lower if it were purely aristocratic in the sense of love of retaliation.
Why, we may ask, were there no social grades in Israel? Possibly
because in proportion to the conquered the conquerors were relatively
more numerous than in Babylonia. Or possibly the conquered were
more thoroughly subdued. Possibly also because the references to
class distinctions have since been expurgated from our copies of the
legislation.</p>

<p>Now let us take the view that the higher law which accepts compensation
for injury in place of strict retaliation emerged later in
Israel. Are we to regard this as a natural evolution? Surely not.
We are not convinced, surely, that it is a higher law or more inspired.
It was probably, as in Babylonia, already the older law of the land
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
before the Israelite invasion, the more civilized law of the more
civilized inhabitants of Canaan. Later, according to the critical
arrangement of the law codes as preserved to us in the Pentateuch,
this more civilized custom is growing, and it has to be forbidden in
the interests of conservatism (Leviticus xxiv. 22). At any rate, there,
after repeating the law of retaliation, differences of treatment are
forbidden. Why should this be done, unless they had been growing?
Later still, in Deuteronomy xix. 21, deviations from strict retaliation
are again forbidden with the words &#8216;thine eye shall not pity&#8217;.
Once more, we may ask, if compensation had not been a growing
custom among the Israelites, why should this effort be made to
strengthen the observance of a lower law? Was it solely because of
their reverence for Moses and his law, or was it not because it was all
along the Canaanite law and so repugnant to the Jewish lawyers?
If so, were not the Canaanites in the same position to the Israelites
as the Babylonian <i>mushk&ecirc;nu</i> to their Amorite conquerors in the old
days of Hammurabi?</p>

<p>The cases in the Book of the Covenant where an injury to a slave
is treated are not to be compared to those in the Code of Hammurabi.
If a slave is freed (Exodus xxi. 26) for a bad assault on him, it is an
assault by his master, for which Hammurabi has no notice. Hammurabi&#8217;s
cases of assault on a slave are by one who is not his master.
There is nothing here to show that the law was not exactly the same
for both legislations for the same cases. As far as our evidence goes
one law treats one case and omits the other, the other law treats the
last case and omits the first.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the Book of the Covenant is here not consistent
with itself. A man might beat his servant to death, provided he did
not &#8216;die under his hand&#8217;, and go unpunished, but he might not knock
out his eye without having to free him. Obviously, then, if he did knock
out his eye, his wisest plan was to so injure him further that he should
die. In any case he lost his slave. One can hardly help suspecting
that these two clauses belong to different periods. What the Babylonian
master could do to his slave without incurring punishment we
do not now know. If a slave ran away and was brought back his
master could put him in fetters. If the slave repudiated his master&#8217;s
authority he was punished by mutilation. But Hammurabi does not
otherwise interfere between master and slave. Probably he, too,
counted on the master&#8217;s regard for his own property.</p>

<p>The case of a slave who married a free wife comes up both in the
Code (&sect; 176) and in Exodus xxi. 3. Hammurabi makes the woman
and her children exempt from the master&#8217;s power. So does Moses,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
if the man had married before he became a slave. Of course, if his
master gave him a wife, the master retained power over her and the
children. We cannot, however, suppose that if the enslaved Hebrew
married a free woman while in servitude that the master claimed to
treat her as a slave. Probably, however, the master had power to
forbid such a marriage. Thus there really was no case likely to arise
in Israel to compare with that legislated for in Babylonia, which
law regulated all cases except this in Canaan also. The only new
regulation which had come into use is the restriction on the man&#8217;s
term of service. To meet the case of a man who preferred perpetual
servitude in domestic comfort to destitute freedom he was allowed to
be ear-marked for the purpose (Exodus xxi. 6).</p>

<p>The Book of the Covenant extends the right of release to females
(Exodus xxi. 7) with a proviso. If her master has used her as a concubine
he cannot sell her. Either he must continue to treat her as
a wife or give her freedom. In the Code of Hammurabi the concubine
has the same rights, whether she had been slave or free woman
originally, if she has borne children. If she has not borne children
to her master she may still be treated as a slave if a slave before.
The contrast between the laws is only apparent. A Hebrew could
not sell his slave whom he had used as concubine, although she were
childless, and the Babylonian could. But, it must be noted that the
Nippur copy of the Code, perhaps embodying South Babylonian
custom such as Abraham may have learned in Ur, omits the clause
allowing the sale of the childless slave-concubine. As a slave she
had to go out in three years, if once a free woman, according to the
Code (&sect; 176), which is the case contemplated by Moses who, however,
permits six years&#8217; servitude as in the case of male servants (Exodus
xxi. 7). If the slave-girl became betrothed to her master&#8217;s son she
rose to the status of a daughter, which conferred freedom despite her
previous status.</p>

<p>The Code of Hammurabi punishes kidnapping of a freeborn man
with death (&sect; 14). To steal a slave was just common theft, and
that also was punished with death (&sect; 15). Moses combines the two
cases in one (Exodus xxi. 16): &#8216;he that stealeth a man shall surely be
put to death.&#8217; The clause which adds &#8216;and selleth him or if he be
found in his hand&#8217; constitutes no contrast. It does not appear very
illuminating. For what purpose any one would steal a man except
to sell him as a slave or keep him as such is not easy to see. But
it does recall the insistence of the Code that a man-stealer to be
convicted as such must be caught &#8216;with the slave in his hand&#8217; (&sect; 19).
In fact the Book of the Covenant seems here to have somewhat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
awkwardly condensed &sect;&sect; 14-20 of the Code, attempting to make the
law apply to any man, slave or free, without expressly naming the
slave. But it does name one case which Hammurabi omitted to
notice&mdash;when the man-stealer had succeeded in selling his capture.
The sale might be difficult to prove, but in a country where scarcely
anything was sold without a deed of sale on which the Code insists
so clearly no buyer would easily be found. In any case Hammurabi
could hardly have meant that a man-stealer was only to be punished if
he had not succeeded in passing on his captive. How the Book of the
Covenant contemplated proof of sale would be found does not appear.
It is to be borne in mind that a man-stealer was only likely to attempt
to kidnap a child or a slave. Hammurabi legislates fully for both
cases; Moses apparently attempts to include all cases under one term
and condenses the carefully distinguished cases of the Code, and
leaves a law which as the Book of the Covenant now preserves its
regulations can scarcely be called clear.</p>

<p>In the case of grievous assault the Code demands an oath of lack of
malice and payment of the doctor. Moses omits the oath, Exodus xxi.
18 f., and orders payment for loss of time. The injured man seems
to have been left to get well as best he could, or the doctor may
have been ignored because his practices were connected with idolatry.
But the words &#8216;cause him to be thoroughly healed&#8217; surely imply the
existence in Israel of some sort of doctor. Anyway, the customary
justice underlying both laws is the same. If the injured man dies
Hammurabi admits oath of want of malice (&sect; 207) and fixes the
compensation. Here in Exodus xxi. 13 Moses allows the right of
asylum. This is a most marked difference, and a whole literature
has grown up about the question of asylum and the Cities of Refuge.
It is impossible here to work out the question. We must, however,
notice that the Book of the Covenant does not specify the usage as
to asylum at that period. We can hardly quote the regulations given,
say in Numbers xxxv, which are held by critics to be of later date
and may embody considerable changes. One of these changes forbids
the innocent slayer to leave his asylum until the death of the
high priest. That is considered certainly to be of late date. It is
associated with a prohibition to take a satisfaction for the deed. If
this be also late it marks a growing custom or the recrudescence of
an earlier usage. Whenever it held sway the ultimate fate of the
innocent man-slayer was the same as in the Code. He had to pay
a compensation to the relatives of the slain man.</p>

<p>Now we may consider several alternatives. This custom of asylum
or purgation by oath, both implied or prescribed in Israel and Babylonia,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
was also associated with compensation to the relatives both in
Israel and Babylonia at some time. In Babylonia it was so in the
time of Hammurabi and, if not in Israel at the time of the Book of
the Covenant, some time later before the prohibition.</p>

<p>In Babylonia the man-slayer would be tried on the capital charge
before a court. Whether he had to flee for refuge to the temple to
escape the avenger of blood does not appear. But the court was
certain to be held there, and the oath was before the altar or emblem
of the god. In Israel he had so to flee. He had to be tried on the
capital charge there. His oath of purgation implies a trial there.
Exodus xxi. 14 implies that a murderer would take refuge there. In
neither law are the details given explicitly, but we cannot point out
any contradiction; all we can say is that each omits what the other
records. We must admit, however, that there may have been real and
essential differences here.</p>

<p>Cases of theft show much the same treatment, allowing for adaptation
to changed circumstances. The burglar in the Code of Hammurabi
was killed on the spot and gibbeted before the breach he had
made. In the Book of the Covenant this right to self-help is only
allowed if the burglary takes place at night. It may be that the
Code also contemplates nocturnal burglary alone, as did the Roman
XII Tables. There is, however, no explicit statement on the point.
The case of burglary in daylight, however, implies the possibility of
calling in assistance. That the death penalty should be inflicted in
the Code of Hammurabi for the brigand, for the thief who enters
a temple or palace, both public treasuries, to steal, for the stealer
at a neighbour&#8217;s fire, are not to be alleged as contrasts so long as
we do not know what the penalties inflicted on such criminals
should be. We cannot suppose such crimes unknown in Israel or so
rare as not to be dealt with. All we can say is that what we have
left of the Book of the Covenant does not notice them.</p>

<p>A very remarkable set of differences strikes our attention when we
consider the fines for theft or fraud. In the Code of Hammurabi
restitution might be demanded up to thirty-fold in some cases or only
double in others. In the Book of the Covenant it ranges from double
to five-fold. The treatment is certainly completely independent.
Actual reasons for the amount of penalty are given in no single case.
We may suggest some, with little confidence, however, in their real
influence in antiquity.</p>

<p>That the Code of Hammurabi punishes the aristocrat so sharply
may have been due to the uneradicated predatory instinct of his
Amorite retainers, or to the arrogance of conquerors who were disposed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
to hold that the conquered had no rights against them. That
the Book of the Covenant instances only ox and sheep may be due to
the fact that its legislation was meant for a pastoral folk entering
upon a new environment. The peculiar numerical calculations which
brought about the penalty of multiple restitution and decided how
many times may have been founded on some theory as to the significance
of numbers which now escapes us.</p>

<p>But one point must be carefully borne in mind. The Code of
Hammurabi states the maximum penalty. Its &#8216;shall&#8217; is not imperative
but permissive, it may best be rendered &#8216;may&#8217;. A considerable
licence was allowed to judges, and there was always appeal to a higher
court and ultimately to the king.</p>

<p>Damage to crops by animals is explicitly treated both by the Code
and by the Book of the Covenant. Hammurabi (&sect; 57) separates two
types of damage&mdash;one where the crop may recover and even benefit
by the growing corn being fed off and trodden by sheep, the other
where the corn in the ear is irretrievably destroyed. It is not clearly
the case, however, which is treated in Exodus xxii. 5. If not, then
we can allege no contrast; but the LXX and the Samaritan Pentateuch
add the case of complete consumption. This might be due to
a later acquisition of knowledge concerning Babylonian or Canaanite
usage, but is so distinct that we cannot fairly insist on conscious
antiquarian interest. The case could hardly be left undecided.</p>

<p>Damage by flooding a neighbour&#8217;s field, dealt with in the Code,
&sect;&sect; 53-6, is foreign to Israelite soil, irrigation being rare, but the
same type of law is given for damage by fire in Exodus xxii. 6. This
is not referred to in the Code.</p>

<p>The Code of Hammurabi deals at length with the case of property
claimed as lost from a holder who asserts ownership (&sect;&sect; 9-13). The
corresponding section of the Book of the Covenant, Exodus xxii. 9,
may be said to condense the whole with extreme brevity thus: In
any case of breach of trust, whether it concern ox or ass or sheep or
clothing, or any kind of lost thing of which one saith &#8216;This is it,
the case of both parties shall come before God; he whom God shall
condemn shall make double restitution to his neighbour&#8217;. This
seems to be the best that <span class="smcap">Professor Kent</span> can make of the Hebrew.
Now can any unprejudiced person suppose for a moment that this
clause sets out a new law in an intelligible fashion. Is it not obviously
drawn up in the manner of one who is summarizing a well-known
series of enactments? To my mind it is very difficult to resist the
impression that it is meant to reduce a rather wide and perhaps not
a very uniform series of judgements to a single formula. That the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
law thus sought to be simplified was the Code of Hammurabi does
not appear, for the simplification is of a type that destroys almost all
likeness. Only this may be said: in both legislations, if any man is
found holding property his right to which is challenged by another,
the claims of both are to be rehearsed before the judges. So far the
resemblance is exact, but while the Code takes each contingency
separately, and whoever is proved to have made a false claim is judged
to be a would-be thief and as such condemned to death, in the Book
of the Covenant the culprit has merely to pay double to the man he
has defrauded. This is indeed a marked change, if not improvement.
But one would expect progress in five hundred or a thousand years of
settled life in Canaan. That so primitive a folk as Israel is usually
supposed to have been on entrance into Canaan, or even in the early
days of the monarchy, should have a law so advanced would be
remarkable enough. But we note that apparently the Book of the
Covenant wishes to include breach of trust as well as unlawful
detention of property.</p>

<p>Now the law of deposit or trust is dealt with in the Code very
clearly and precisely. The depositee is responsible for all loss. Even
if the deposited goods are stolen from him he must repay and recover
at his own charges from the thief if he can find him. If the depositee
wrongly denies or disputes the deposit he pays double. One point
only is not decided. The thief has, of course, to be killed when
caught. But he may not be caught, and his death in any case will
not restore the goods. Now Exodus xxii. 7, dealing with deposit also,
does not repeat or resume the surely necessary points treated by the
Code, but does take up one of its difficulties. If the thief is caught
he, too, pays double. If he cannot be produced, the depositee is
brought to the judges to see if he has appropriated the goods. The
sequel is not stated, but is usually supplied by supposing it covered
by verse 11, which, however, formally applies to a different case, the
case of animals entrusted to a shepherd or farmer, which is treated in
the Code (&sect;&sect; 244, 249, 267). There unavoidable accidents are cleared
by an oath of innocence, just as in verse 11. But as in Exodus xxii. 13,
evidence of the animal being killed by a lion is demanded in the
production of the remains; we can hardly regard this as on all fours
with robbery from a granary, for example. In the case of negligence
or theft of a deposit both legislations require restitution. There are
certainly differences, but no fundamental difference of view. No one
can deny that the regulations in the Book of the Covenant might
have arisen quite independently, founded on natural experience; but
surely, in that case, the law would have explicitly treated more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
points. These must have arisen in practice. Why were they not
treated?</p>

<p>The answer which seems to meet the case is that the Book of the
Covenant assumes just what the Code contains, repeats some of it
summarily, adds a fresh case or two, revises the penalties, but, if
completely preserved, does all this in a rather crude fashion. We
may not have it all, and that must not be forgotten. The Exodus
passage as it stands has all the appearance of supplementary legislation,
and, if it be as early as is commonly supposed, where are we to
look for what it assumes already known?</p>

<p>So far we have instituted a comparison between the Hammurabi
Code and the Book of the Covenant without exploiting the subsequent
Hebrew legislation. We have seen great likeness mingled with
decided contrasts. We have followed quite carefully critical views
without being able to exhaust all the ramifications of criticism. We
have taken the usual acceptation of the Hebrew laws. Considerations
of time and space prevent our extending our researches to the limits
of exhausting our subject. Much clearly remains to be done. We
could examine most of the points taken up much more closely.
Before we leave this part of our subject let us look from another
point of view at the cases of slavery already dealt with.</p>

<p>The Book of the Covenant, Exodus xxi, legislates for slaves, both
male and female, but especially for those of Hebrew race. A moment&#8217;s
consideration will show that this is not an exhaustive treatment of the
questions relating even to them; only selected points are dealt with.
Now we may ask, Why should just those points be selected? Was it
because the nomads before entering Canaan had no slaves, or were
there none of the Hebrew race, or was it the case that in the desert
none could sink so low? Or were there no slaves under the early
kings of Israel? At what time did the use of slaves arise? Definite
ideas on such points are necessary before theories of the date of the
laws can be sustained. The usual view is that the institution of
slavery is long anterior among the Israelites to the Book of the
Covenant, whose regulations introduce no new regulations, only fix
customary usages. On the other hand, a very frequent view is that
a change in habits on entrance into Canaan had brought new conditions
and so had given rise to new sociological problems. Perhaps
the conquest of Canaan added largely to the numbers of slaves. The
older views on the subject of slavery had to be modified in order to
meet new conditions. The Book of the Covenant on this view did
introduce new regulations which aimed at teaching a newly settled
folk how to treat particular cases. Did the lawgiver, then, treat the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
subject <i>de novo</i>, or merely adopt regulations already in force in
Canaanite cities, or did he seek inspiration from the land to which his
people&#8217;s traditions ascribed their origin?</p>

<p>Now the answer to such a question depends upon what we can
find elsewhere in the people&#8217;s previous experience in the desert, in
Canaan, or in dim memories of far-off Babylonian days. That is to
say, if these really denoted distinct epochs in their history with
distinct civilizations. For if a law on these points already existed,
was recalled, or observed in force, which proves to be practically the
same as that here adopted, or could be ascertained on inquiry by
Hebrew legislators, then the view that they did not attempt to ascertain
it, nor recalled it, nor observed it, but independently concocted
a fresh law, and in so doing hit upon exactly the same result as they
might have ascertained, recalled, or observed, needs only to be stated
to refute itself. An appeal to inspiration to explain this kind of
miracle is only laughable, and if the best of men professed to so
account for any of his actions in ordinary life, we could only doubt
his sanity so long as we believed his sincerity.</p>

<p>The Code of Hammurabi had existed for five hundred years or more,
and it shows what a settled folk of same racial type under much the
same conditions did achieve on the subject. We must, then, show
that the Book of the Covenant treats things differently, or that its
author could not well be aware of this Code, before we can safely
deny that he is indebted to it. Such reasoning has led many scholars
to assert roundly that the Hebrew legislation is derived directly from
the Babylonian. But for argument&#8217;s sake let us start by assuming
that the regulations in the Book of the Covenant are original and
devised solely to meet the circumstances in Canaan at some early
period in the Israelite predominance there, and let us consider these
regulations more closely.</p>

<p>The regulations appear to concern a Hebrew slave. The first
question we ask in astonishment is: How came a Hebrew to be a slave?
We probably all know of amazing feats of exegetical dexterity
achieved over this question. The Book of the Covenant, however,
only adduces the one case of a man sold by the judicial authority for
a theft which he was unable to restore (Exodus xxii. 3). The later
law in Deuteronomy xv. 12 appears to add the slave acquired by purchase.
Who had then the right to sell him? If a Babylonian was
captured by the enemy and offered for sale as a slave to his compatriots
he had to be ransomed by his own family, his city, or the state, and
was restored to freedom and not enslaved any longer. Surely a Hebrew
would not be worse treated. The law of P. explains the case more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
clearly (Leviticus xxv. 39): &#8216;If thy brother be waxen poor with thee,
and sell himself unto thee.&#8217; We may regard this as later, but can
we deny that the case itself was not supposed all along? It is most
probable that the only way in which a Hebrew could become a slave
in his own land to serve a Hebrew master was in some such fashion,
which is not really slavery at all.</p>

<p>There is no evidence to show that captives in war, reduced to
slavery, or the slaves bought in the open slave market, foreigners in
either case, would be freed from slavery at any time, under this law or
any other. Later, Leviticus xxv. 44-6 expressly sanctions such
being &#8216;bondmen for ever&#8217;, and this was everywhere the natural
custom.</p>

<p>The Hebrew &#8216;slave&#8217;, as he has hitherto been called, contemplated
in this law, as understood somewhat later, is simply one who
had assigned himself or had been assigned by lawful authority to his
holder to work off a debt which he himself had contracted. Such in
Rome became a real slave, and might easily have so become in Israel
and Babylonia but for Moses and Hammurabi. There is no evidence
that a Hebrew was ever a slave in any other sense. We shall return
to the point again. This is not really a slave but a hostage for debt.
Hammurabi had a special name for him, as had the Roman law. The
Hebrew term covers such, using a word that may mean a servant,
a hostage for debt, or a proper slave.</p>

<p>This &#8216;slave&#8217;, then, worked off his debt by unpaid service. When
Leviticus xxv. 40 lays down the rule that he shall not serve as a bondservant
but shall be as a hired servant, it bears in mind that he was
not a slave at all, but had temporarily lost his freedom. He was like
the sojourner, still free, but not fully free. It could not be meant to
order that wages were to be paid, only that no such exacting service
should be required as was evidently the rule for bondservants or real
slaves. &#8216;Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour&#8217; is a good gloss
on the case. For it was naturally a temptation to the holder to get
as much work out of this &#8216;slave&#8217; as he could, in order to recoup the
debt or purchase-money in view of the approaching release.</p>

<p>It is most important here to note that the law takes no account of
the amount of debt. A purely commercial spirit would have estimated
the yearly average value of the slave&#8217;s work above his keep and
clothing, and then would fix the term of service at such a length as
would suffice to work off the debt and its interest. That such
calculations were made in Babylonia is evident from existing documents.
In the existing state of legislation in Israel we may assume
that a man who was in debt, knowing that if he sold himself for debt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
he would have to serve six years, would not sell himself unless he saw
some fair equivalence between the work he would have to perform in
that time and the amount he owed. He could hire himself out as
a hired servant and pay off the debt with the money, possibly in less
time. So it was ruled that if he did elect to serve out his debt
he is not to be made to work harder than a hired servant would
have to do.</p>

<p>In the Book of the Covenant, then, it seems that a Hebrew was only
likely to get into such a position as a result of crime for which he
could not pay the fine or a theft which he could not restore, and so by
judicial sentence or by voluntary self-assignment for debt.</p>

<p>In such cases the law rules that whatever was the amount of debt
six years&#8217; service must be held to discharge it. That opened the way
to abuses in two directions. The service might be an insufficient
discharge, and so the holder, if the debt was due to him, or the
purchaser of the convict, would be cheated; or the man who had
suffered the theft be not remunerated. So it is not to be supposed
that when a man was sold to pay for a theft which he had committed
the buyer would pay more for him than he could reasonably expect to
get back by six years&#8217; service. Thus the way was opened to a second
abuse, excessive exaction of labour from the slave. Later legislation
recognized the existence of just these abuses and attempted redress.</p>

<p>Now all this is completely like the Code of Hammurabi, which
already provided for the abuses as well (&sect; 117 ff.). The Code deals
with the man assigned, literally &#8216;named&#8217;, <i>nibutum</i>, like the Roman
<i>nuncupatus</i>, to work off a debt. The Code expressly reserves the
right of &#8216;naming&#8217; this hostage to the debtor himself. The creditor
had no power to seize the debtor or distrain on his goods or dependants.
If he does he is fined and voids his debt at once. It also,
like the Book of the Covenant, contains cases where a man might be
sold with his family, and of course his goods, to pay a liability which
he had incurred through culpable negligence. Neither it nor the
Book of the Covenant expressly brings this case under the law
of release. It does not record the case of a man actually &#8216;naming&#8217;
himself as <i>mancipium</i>. But that surely is not excluded from
possibility, and we know from actually recorded cases that it
occurred.</p>

<p>The points of difference are (i) the term of service&mdash;fixed by the
Code at three years, by the Book of the Covenant at six years;
(ii) the regulations against the ill-treatment of the hostage; (iii) the
regulation for the case of the man who wished to remain a slave
for ever.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>On these we may remark, first that in Israel the term of six years
imposed by the Book of the Covenant was evidently resented, and has
to be explained as really a double term (Deuteronomy xv. 18). Surely
that indicates a knowledge on the part of the later lawgiver of what
was not generally known in Israel, to wit, that the term had once
been three years. Where and when, we may well ask? Surely not
in Israel, or the creditor would not have so resented a regulation
which gave him twice as much for his money. Nor in his neighbour
cities of Canaan, or he would still have recognized his improved
position. It must have been somewhere at a time now forgotten in
a state of things which he would be expected still to respect. Where
else could it be than in Babylonia, the home of his father Abraham?
Would any one have quoted him a law unless it was one he was likely
to respect as eminently just? He may not have known that law by
the name of the Code of Hammurabi, but simply as &#8216;ancient law&#8217; so
highly revered by Orientals in all ages. &#8216;Ye have heard that it was
said by them of old time&#8217; was enough.</p>

<p>Here some one may be disposed to raise the objection that the
creditor was not told that the six years was double the term allowed
by ancient law, but simply that it was &#8216;the double of the hire
of a hired servant&#8217;. Now if that does not mean the same thing it has
no sense at all. For a term cannot be double the hire of anything.
It is the value in work of the term of service which is double a hire.
We must express both terms in the same denomination. In what
sense could six years ever be double of anything but three years?
How can we imagine three years to have any special connexion with
the term of a hired servant? Is there any evidence that servants
were usually hired for three years? The term in Israel, as in Babylon,
must always have been matter of free contract. The writer has in
his mind the other regulation that the hostage for debt must not be
treated worse than a hired servant, and explains the six years&#8217; term
as double what the debtor would be likely to agree to if he was in the
position of a hired servant and free to contract about the term. Why
should he be thus expected to fix upon three years as a term?
Probably because the custom, which had come down from the time
when Canaan observed the same usages which Hammurabi codified,
regarded three years as a proper term. If this view be thought not
convincing, it may be rejected.</p>

<p>It is at least curious that the excuse given for demanding release
for a hostage for debt at the end of six years is that this is after all
double something&mdash;when it actually is double the term Hammurabi
fixed. In whatever way the Deuteronomist meant his reader to understand
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
his explanation it is difficult to imagine what else was in his
mind. The something which he appears to allege may be a gloss on
his words. The text may once have said &#8216;for the double he hath
served thee&#8217;, and a dull glossator may have sought within his own
consciousness for the rather pointless example suggested by the other
reference to a hired servant&#8217;s service.</p>

<p>Anyway, the term is explained as a double one, and it was double
of the term in the Hammurabi Code.</p>

<p>The second point of difference has a suggestion of greater ruthlessness
in Babylonia in treatment of a hostage. &#8216;Blows and starvation&#8217;
point to efforts to get more out of the hostage. This, too, is the
underlying thought of the later legislation in Israel which forbids his
treatment as a bondservant.</p>

<p>The third point, too, suggests that in Babylonia it rarely occurred
to a man to prefer comfort with servitude to freedom and destitution.
The lot of the free destitute may have been more hopeless in Israel,
the lot of the slave less tolerable in Babylonia. Or the love of
freedom may have been greater in Babylonia. In any case, such
a difference in law is the sort of addition which might be expected to
grow up in five hundred years of advance, in a different state of
society and a far-off land.</p>

<p>In the last resource the ground principle remains the same.
A debtor may name himself, or one of his family, or his slave, as
hostage for debt, but whatever the amount of debt, the hostage shall
not be held beyond a fixed term. This in both laws only applies to
a free individual and never affected a real &#8216;slave&#8217;.</p>

<p>We have hitherto assumed that the law contemplates only the
Hebrew male &#8216;slave&#8217;. But are we to suppose that when an Israelite
got into debt or was sold to pay an obligation that he alone was
responsible? Could not he also assign his wife or child or slave to
work off his debt? And if he did, are we to understand that they
could be kept for ever in bondage? The words of the Book of the
Covenant do not expressly answer any of these questions, but only
a very pedantic interpretation of the letter of the law could confine
its operation to the male head of the family.</p>

<p>We do have, however, an indirect answer in the next two clauses.
He might come in alone or he might bring in his wife (and family
presumably) with him. If so, they had to be released with him.
The case where he assigned them in his place is not mentioned. Are
we to assume that this was not done? Subsequent legislation extended
the law. Deuteronomy xv. 17 has &#8216;so shalt thou do to thy
female slave&#8217;. This may have been necessary to prevent an abuse
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
of refusing to release a female &#8216;slave&#8217; sold to work off a debt, on the
plea that she was not covered by the words of the Act. This would
be to assume a litigious spirit, of which we have no other proof to
allege. It is better to regard it as commentary. It may, indeed, be
contended that the law was intended to cover only one special case,
but it is more reasonable to suppose that it takes a special case as
norm for all.</p>

<p>Now what is this the law of? To call it the rights of the Hebrew
slave is surely to miss the whole point. It is still more misleading to
call it the law of male slaves. It is the law of the hostage for debt.
It concerns only the person assigned as <i>mancipium</i>. No other comes
into view. And such is not a slave at all. There is, therefore, here
no information about the treatment of slaves in Israel. All the fine
talk about the humane character of the Mosaic law may apply elsewhere,
not here. The law simply insists on the release of a debtor
held to work off a debt at the end of a fixed term.</p>

<p>The further details of the case in the Book of the Covenant are
considerations of special cases&mdash;(i) if the debtor is a single man when
he enters on his term of service, (ii) or accompanied by his wife (and
family?), (iii) if provided by his creditor with a wife during his service,
(iv) if he prefers servitude in domestic freedom to destitute freedom.
On these grounds we may remark&mdash;</p>

<p>(i) That he should go forth alone if he came in alone merely
heightens the contrast. No restraint of the holder&#8217;s freedom is
intended, but a limitation of the debtor&#8217;s claim. If his holder finds
him a wife, and so children, he cannot claim to take them with him,
that is all.</p>

<p>(ii) If his wife accompanied him she has the same rights to release
as he has. His family is not named, but was surely in the same
position. What is here ruled is simply that this class of servitude
does not forfeit freedom for any one.</p>

<p>(iii) It is obvious that the holder might give him a slave-woman
to be his wife. Had he been fully free the children of such a
marriage would be at his own disposal. Now they are the holder&#8217;s
property. As a single man held to work off his debt he probably
was not free to choose his own wife. His children were a species of
profit to his holder, just as if he were an ox.</p>

<p>(iv) The case where the man chooses to stay is instructive from
many points: for a Hebrew could thus become a slave for ever.
There were no degradations if no grades were recognized, and there
were no religious disabilities. It did not even preclude wealth. The
boring of his ear by the awl was a significant way of nailing his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
obedience, of which the ear was the organ and symbol, to a particular
house.</p>

<p>So far in our comparison of the Code and the Book of the Covenant
we have been content to show likenesses and contrasts. But there
are not lacking cases in which some have not failed to see deliberate
conscious change. One of the most surprising things in the Book of
the Covenant, if it belongs there at all, is the prohibition to &#8216;favour the
poor man&#8217;, Exod. xxiii. 3. The direction must be addressed to persons
in the position of judges. It is sometimes maintained that the Book
of the Covenant shows no trace of judges. However that may be,
the directions must be addressed to those who decided causes, judges
under some other name.</p>

<p>Now why was the poor man not to be favoured? We should not
be at all surprised at judges being told not to favour the rich man.
It can never have been superfluous in the East. But the Code does
favour the <i>mushk&ecirc;nu</i>. We have seen that he was called &#8216;a poor
man&#8217; by several translators after the rendering &#8216;noble&#8217; had been
given up. That was partly because the Hebrew <i>mesk&icirc;n</i> has always
been taken to mean a poor man. Perhaps the original text of
Exod. xxiii. 3 had <i>mesk&icirc;n</i>. Then the later redactor, who seems to
have known the Code, may have wished to obliterate a tell-tale word.
The Code did favour the <i>mushk&ecirc;nu</i> in the sense that he could do
wrong at less expense than his superiors. Also his offerings in the
Temple were allowed to be smaller. Now this is exactly how
Leviticus does favour a poor man, and that again suggests that by
&#8216;poor man&#8217; the Hebrew legislator did mean the same as the
Babylonian <i>mushk&ecirc;nu</i>. Now if this otherwise very odd remark in
Exod. xxiii. 3 was really old, one wonders that the Leviticus law
does so favour &#8216;the poor&#8217;. But Exod. xxiii. 3 might well be passed
later to abrogate this Babylonian tendency. Exod. xxx. 15 expressly
forbids the rich to pay more or the poor less. The same
word for &#8216;poor&#8217; occurs in all cases. Did then the early Hebrew
law aim at reversing the Code&#8217;s rule that &#8216;poor men&#8217;, or rather
&#8216;plebeians&#8217;, should pay less? We may suppose that the Canaanites
were the <i>mushk&ecirc;nu</i> in Israel. The &#8216;sojourners&#8217; obviously were.
But Hammurabi had neither riches nor poverty in view when he
favoured the <i>mushk&ecirc;nu</i>. By the Tell-el-Amarna period the name
had lost its exact value and become even in Babylonia more contemptuous.
Later in Israel it became a name for a beggar. Did
the Hebrew legislator catch the word when it only conveyed the
meaning &#8216;poor&#8217;, and use his own term to avoid ambiguity?</p>

<p>The idea of God as the ultimate source of punishment is inferred
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
as characteristic in the Book of the Covenant from Exod. xxi. 6;
xxii. 8, 9, where the offender is brought &#8216;unto the judges&#8217;. These
words are now more usually rendered &#8216;before God&#8217;, as there is no
apparent reason why the word usually rendered &#8216;God&#8217; should here
be rendered &#8216;judges&#8217;, beyond a late opinion that such was the
meaning of the phrase. This opinion is correct in so far as that
analogy with Babylonia leads us to suppose that in every trial before
judges the parties and the witnesses were put on oath before God.
This direct appeal to God as the all-seeing Judge of men is in complete
accord with the Babylonian practice, as revealed by the Code of
Hammurabi. The conscience of the criminal and the fear of God&#8217;s
vengeance on the perjured were in old times very powerful motives.</p>

<p>It is often said that the Jewish law is theocratic. So it is, when
regarded as a whole and in the sense noted in the last paragraph.
But this is not the attitude of the Judgements contained in the Book
of the Covenant. At any rate they are not more theocratic than the
Code of Hammurabi, which is extraordinarily free of religious motive.
The type of a theocratic code is the Laws of Manu, a much more
primitive type than the Laws of Moses. In some respects the Code
of Hammurabi is practically a civil code, and so ahead of the Laws
of Moses. But it must not be taken as a criterion of age that the
Mosaic law is theocratic, nor pressed as a mark of primitive law.
For it is theocratic mostly in a peculiar sense. The civil law of
Israel comes to us embedded in a mass of religious law, and prefaced
by a narrative of its production, serving to connect it with its
divine author. Some portion of this framework bears a strong
formal likeness to the Code of Hammurabi. This has been pointed
out by <span class="smcap">S. A. Cook</span> who, however, does not regard it as a sign of
dependence.</p>

<p>We must, however, allow some weight, one way or another, to this
likeness. Either this setting is original, or it is not. If it essentially
belongs to the Book of the Covenant, that is theocratic to about the
same extent as the Code of Hammurabi, and another striking similarity
is added to the list of arguments for dependence. If it is not
original, then the Book of the Covenant, unlike the rest of the
Hebrew law, was originally purely civil unless it had a different
religious setting (Babylonian or Canaanite?), and so still more like
the body of the Code of Hammurabi.</p>

<p>We have two pictures, so to speak, with very similar art and very
similar frames. In one case we know the picture and its frame are
contemporary. In the case of the other, which is certainly later,
both picture and frame are very like the older. If now the later
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
frame be not contemporary with its picture, we cannot use it to
conclude that the pictures are independent studies of the same
subject. It gives no evidence as to its picture. If the later frame
be original and contemporary, the later cannot be treated as an
example of art repeating itself. The copied frame is a very significant
argument in favour of the later picture being regarded as
a copy too. Now it is very important to much of the critical
argument that the frame is original.</p>

<h2>LECTURE III</h2>

<p>In the first and second lectures we have dwelt upon the external
features of the two codes of law to be compared, and pointed out some
things remarkably similar. We have now to consider the various
theories which have been propounded to account for them. The
progress of the discussion has shown that the higher critics are as
eager as the orthodox Jewish or Christian writers to repel the oft-repeated
assertions of dependence.</p>

<p>There are obviously many ways of treating the resemblances and
accounting for the differences, and some of them may, and probably
will, long be held which do not attempt to take account of more than
a selection of the facts. That theory will surely be finally accepted
which takes account of all the facts. Hasty dogmatism only
succeeds in imposing on the credulous public and provokes the
resentment of those whose judgement is alone worth considering.
I should esteem it then a real misfortune if anything I might say
should lead any one to form a conclusion based solely on what he
considers to be my opinion. Therefore I expressly warn you that
I have not given you my opinion, nor do I intend to do so. I desire
solely to make you aware of the facts, and invite you to form your
own opinion.</p>

<p>Now the first thing to deal with is the general similarity of the
Code to the Book of the Covenant, considered as our best witness to
the primitive Hebrew law. It has been calculated that out of forty-five,
or possibly fifty-five judgements preserved in this old Hebrew
law, thirty-five have points of contact with the Hammurabi Code,
and quite half are parallel. Of course, there are also marked differences
to be accounted for. The Hebrew law appears to have
legislated for a small people, among whom human life was precious
and property scanty. The Babylonian law protects property with
far severer penalty, and makes little account of a criminal&#8217;s life.
This is appropriate to a nation of commercial instincts and a wealthy
populous state. It recognizes grades of wealth and position. The
theft of an ox is punished by a five-fold restoration in the Hebrew
law, in the Babylonian by thirty times its value, or in the plebeian&#8217;s
case by a ten-fold penalty. We may estimate the difference by
saying that in the desert five oxen was about all a man had, and his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
family would probably have to help him to pay, and so the penalty
was an effective restraint; while in Babylonia, thirty oxen were to
many men not more costly, and even the commoner was twice as
wealthy as an Israelite. It is, however, more likely that the penalties
were not calculated at all upon an estimate of what they meant to
the criminal, but on an artificial system of the value of numbers.
For example, in Israel, five may have been ideally complete.
<span class="smcap">Professor D. H. M&uuml;ller</span> has most ingeniously worked out the
possible significance of the numbers.</p>

<p>It is not particularly profitable to insist upon the superior humanity
of either code. Impartial judges, acquainted with ancient codes,
will perceive that the balance between the rights of the individual
and those of the State is always very difficult to hold level. Severe
penalties may be due to the determination to suppress crime at any
cost. The desire to save the criminal from the results of his crime
is not to be expected of any early legislator. Only when his life was
worth more to the State than the loss he was likely to cause could
the criminal hope for pardon. As Hammurabi put it, the king
might wish to save his servant&#8217;s life.</p>

<p>Points of close agreement are numerous. The treatment of
sorcery, the law of deposit, the punishment of kidnapping, injury to
a pregnant woman, regulations as to shepherds, and a score more
may be noted as very similar. These are given in many books, very
conveniently in <span class="smcap">Professor S. R. Driver</span>&#8217;s <i>Genesis</i> in the <i>Cambridge
Bible for Schools</i>.</p>

<p>Now on such a view of the general similarities many have expressed
the opinion that the Hebrew laws are a more or less revised adaptation
of the Babylonian law, perhaps as locally already modified in Canaan
to suit the prejudices of the invaders while they were changing their
habits of life and became a settled people. But this view is not vivid
enough for others. There is a certain delight which some feel in
propounding views calculated to shock some one. The cruder view
that the Hebrew lawgiver, call him Moses or some higher critical
periphrasis for the same thing, sat down with a cuneiform copy of
the Code before him and copied out the Babylonian laws with some
adaptations, may have been enunciated with some such amiable wish,
but was too crude to disturb any one. It is barely worth record.
The differences between the Codes are too important for us to adopt
it. If he made a copy it was a very bad copy. Some allowance for
the difference in age must also be made. Such a length of time as
five hundred to a thousand years must have been marked by great
changes in Babylonia or in Canaan. The advent of the Israelites
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
must have introduced new forces into the life of Palestine. Here
we have to weigh carefully our evidence, which points on the whole
to the Israelite contribution being more primitive in type, and in
some degree a return to early conditions which held before the
time of Hammurabi in Babylonia. Dear as these changes were
to the later Jewish mind, they were not what we should call
improvements.</p>

<p>But when merely considering such general resemblances, along
with such marked differences, we can readily see that a theory of
common origin will suffice to account for the likenesses; while
many subordinate theories can be put forward to account for the
differences. Between the theories of these differences it must be
impossible to decide until we know more accurately the exact
circumstances of the Israelites at, or soon after, their conquest of
Canaan. We may, for example, have to regard the conquest as
extending over a long period and admitting of many gradations of
supremacy in different parts. It is not likely that a clean sweep was
made of the old inhabitants and their customs at any one epoch or
place. We may have to extend this period of conquest down to
the end of the time of the Judges. Parallels are not wanting in the
history of Babylonia. The so-called Amorites had been some centuries
in the land before Hammurabi&#8217;s supremacy, even before they appear
as founding a dynasty.</p>

<p>A favourite theory of the resemblances is that they are due to a
common Semitic origin. Let us examine that theory more closely.
In support of it we have to show that the common features are of
a Semitic type. This is more difficult than is generally supposed.
When practically the only pastoral nomads whose customs were at
all well known to theologians were the Arabs and, as usually
assumed, the Israelites, many features were put down as Semitic
which are now recognized as rather due to the exigencies of the
nomadic life. The recognition of the Babylonians as a type of
settled Semites led by slow gradations to the admission of other
features as also Semitic, while some things hitherto only known
among Semites have been recognized as the common possession
of many unrelated folk. Gradually, and probably unconsciously,
&#8216;common Semitic origin&#8217; has become a mere euphemism for
&#8216;Babylonian&#8217;. For to what part of the Semitic world can we look
for so advanced a civilization as to be common both to the Babylonian
and Israelite law? It must be at least as advanced as the
things common to those laws and yet not presuppose a state of
society which could not be true of a Semitic people. It would be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
interesting if we can find anywhere a clear sketch of what conceivable
state of society the common Semitic origin really implies.
It might then be argued that no such society ever existed. At
present all we can say is that we do not know where to find it. It is
really only a convenient term, like evolution, to conceal our ignorance
of history.</p>

<p>If it could be shown that just those features which are common
to the Hammurabi Code and the Israelite, and therefore presumably
existed in the common Semitic origin, are unlike anything in the
Sumerian or pre-Semitic laws of Babylonia, then the fact of a common
Semitic origin might have to be admitted without our being able to fix
upon a locality for it. In Babylonia a predominance of Semites, at
least in the north, may be dated, perhaps a thousand years before
Hammurabi, under Sargon of Akkad. But while we know of
Sumerian Family Laws and have references to legal reforms under
the Sumerian Kings of Babylonia even in pre-Sargonic times, we
have not yet sufficient material from those early days to know exactly
how far Hammurabi&#8217;s Code was really an advance upon older
Sumerian law. Slowly but surely we are learning that precisely the
same legal forms were in use, long before Hammurabi, among the
Sumerians of the south. The legal documents of Hammurabi&#8217;s age
are full of the old Sumerian words and phrases, used just as dog-Latin
or Norman-French was in our deeds of early English times. We
could not claim a common use of Teutonic translations of Roman
law terms in England and Germany, if such existed, as proof of a
common Teutonic origin for the laws. But the Hammurabi Code
is full of Semitic translations of Sumerian terms. This would be
quite fatal to the theory of common Semitic origin but for the fact
that the Sumerians had been conquered so long before by Sargon,
and we cannot yet clearly sift out what may have been due to his
Semitic followers from what may have been imposed on them by the
subject Sumerians. The conquest of Babylonia by Elam may have
affected its laws more than we think. The barbarous Elamite punishments
survived in Babylonia, in Mesopotamia, even in Israel, two
thousand years or more. But one can hardly argue much from that.
The early history of Babylonian law is still very obscure, and we can
only state probabilities of more or less cogency.</p>

<p>The Semitic origin seems afflicted by lack of cogency. One
must respect it for the attachment which certain estimable divines
show to it. One rather wonders whether Noah was a Semite as well
as his eldest son, and whether these laws really go back as early as
Shem. Elam had claims to be a Semite, and an early Semitic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
kingdom in Elam seems to have been long predominant there. Was
Elam the real common Semitic home both of Amorites and Israelites?
There was a district not far from the border of Elam over which
Kudur-Mabuk, the father of R&icirc;m-Sin, once ruled, and which was
known as the land of the Amorites. Thence the First Dynasty of
Babylon may have come. Whether the ancestors of Abraham in
Ur of the Chaldees were once Amorites or earlier Elamites we
cannot yet decide. But with all these speculations scientific folk
show small patience: for they have another way of solving the
problem.</p>

<p>It is most probable that some of the features which Hammurabi&#8217;s
Code has in common with the early Hebrew legislation are only
slightly modified from the still earlier codes which date from the
time of earlier Sumerian supremacy in Babylonia. Hence we should
remember that a common Semitic origin may really be only a step
towards a reference of both to an early Babylonian origin. At
present we are not likely to find evidences of early Semitic custom
anywhere so early by some thousand years as in Babylonia; and
though we are quite justified in supposing that Arab customs may
be older still, as they certainly are more primitive, we can never
date them with certainty except when we can show them to arise
purely and simply out of local circumstances. Then we may perhaps
affirm that they must always have been the custom in Arabia and
treat them as a witness to early Semitic law. On this side of the
question Mr. <span class="smcap">S. A. Cook</span>&#8217;s work is invaluable.</p>

<p>But the evolutionist or scientific man has a much easier solution.
He has made a comparison of laws among such foreign folk as are
wholly unconnected with Semites or Sumerians. It is found that all
men everywhere do hit upon much the same solution of the same
social problem. We may say that the likenesses we perceive between
the Code of Hammurabi and the Hebrew laws are due to the natural
dictates of human experience. If we take up the laws, one by one,
which are common to the two systems, we can account for almost all
the likenesses in this way. Some very remarkable similarities have
been shown by <span class="smcap">Professor D. H. M&uuml;ller</span> to exist between the
Code of Hammurabi and the Twelve Tables of the Roman Law.
<span class="smcap">Professor Cohn</span>, of Z&uuml;rich, has pointed out strong likenesses to
the laws of the West Goths. On the other hand, <span class="smcap">Dr. H. Grimme</span>
has pointed out some very close agreements between the Mosaic Laws
and an ancient Semitic Law of Bogos, which goes back before the
coming of the Amhara into Abyssinia. There are some likenesses
even with the old Indian laws of Manu, and even the laws of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Aztecs have been compared. We could not expect much assent if
we argued for a common parentage of these widely scattered laws
and their descent from the Code of Hammurabi.</p>

<p>The scientific view is that the common laws are due to common
human experience, which is much the same everywhere. It is closely
allied with the doctrine of evolution as applied to human institutions.
If we could only assume that the nations developed each separately
and independently, without mutual intercourse, it might suffice. But
for ages before the institutions we are considering, both Babylonia
and Palestine had been the meeting-place of many peoples. We
cannot tell by any <i>a priori</i> method which race introduced which
custom. All we know is that an improvement is often readily
adopted by people from those with whom they come in contact,
even when not forced upon them by conquest. But we also know
that even superior usefulness or comfort is not always sufficient to
keep a custom alive. We now know that without much apparent
reason even an essential craft may die out. In fact, this common
humanity origin of common customs is very useful, like the theory
of evolution, to account for observed results when we have no
knowledge of what preceded them and can only guess at the
previous history. One can then, without fear of contradiction,
assert what we consider most likely to have led up to them as
their antecedents. But these easy explanations do not absolve us
from careful research where history can be produced to work upon.
The evolution of human institutions, if such be a legitimate expression
to use, has many a set-back or reaction, and we may very well at any
time be comparing progress in one history with reaction in another.</p>

<p>But while the evolutionary theory of human institutions may be
appealed to for satisfying our curiosity when no possible answer can
be given by history, there are things often to be observed which it
does not well account for, and then recourse to it is the reverse of
scientific. An illustration taken from the arts may help to clear our
minds on this point. It may be assumed that all men everywhere
may be expected to hit upon the device of burning clay vessels until
they obtain some rude form of pottery and then develop the potter&#8217;s
art to some extent. We may call this evolution. Not only can the
making of pots and pans be adduced from all parts of the globe, but
truly astonishing resemblances can be discovered between pottery
from districts so remote that we cannot believe there can ever have
been communication between them. Here an independent evolution
has produced the same results in unconnected areas. If that were
all, the modern science of pottery evidence would be impossible.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
We cannot afford time or space even to sketch here the chief results
of the intensive comparative study of pottery, which has become so
powerful a weapon in the hands of the modern archaeologist. Not
only the age of the stratum on which it was found, but even the
nationality of the maker, can frequently be asserted beyond reasonable
question. Every one must be familiar with such statements as that
Mycenaean pottery has been found on some site or other recently
examined in Greece, Asia Minor, or Palestine. We are led to suppose
that there is something distinctive about it which fixes its origin and
age quite unmistakably. Now this is not its special fitness for
meeting a want which could be met no other way, so that every
people everywhere must have produced Mycenaean pottery once
they reached the compelling stage of civilization which demanded
it. It is some non-essential feature which marks its distinction
from all other than deliberate imitations of it. It must be something
that appeals to a taste which could only arise after the thing
itself had arisen. The admiration felt for Mycenaean pottery would
lead to a demand for it, and that might lead to imitation of it, but no
conceivable set of circumstances could have led men to achieve it
independently. If this could be conceded, the whole science built on
modern study of pottery comes to an end. The presence of such
pottery in Palestine does not indeed prove that any Mycenaean
potter ever visited the country, but that his wares were brought
there, were valued and in request. Further, the pottery came within
fairly definite limits of time.</p>

<p>Now it is this sort of non-essential, for the most part useless but
approved, characteristic which shows conscious imitation, adoption, or
adaptation, that proves influence, indebtedness, or copying. In this
case instanced, in the absence of all documentary evidence, by its
frequency of occurrence, by its adaptation to local circumstance or
other local appropriateness, we also fix the locality of its origin.
Conclusions of this kind are accepted as legitimate in most modern
researches into prehistoric times.</p>

<p>So if we could fasten upon just such a point in the Code of
Hammurabi which appears so artificial or arbitrary, so purely local in
its character that we cannot imagine it to have independently arisen
elsewhere, we could use it as a test case to decide whether the great
amount of common matter found in that Code and also the Laws of
Moses may be set down as due to common Semitic origin, or to
common human genius faced by similar needs. There is no question
as to the relative age of the codes to be compared; we know definitely
which is older and more original.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us then consider a case which, like the need for pottery, might
arise anywhere when men had reached the same stage of civilization.
A man has lent money to another, or its equivalent in goods. The
debtor, as is commonly the case among men, finds himself unable to
repay the loan, for he has consumed the goods and been unable to
acquire what will replace them. His labour is probably of some
value; it should be worth more than his keep; the surplus value, if he
can find employment and wages, should in time enable him to repay
the debt. Now in his area employment may be scarce, wages low;
but at any rate he may offer to work for his creditor. The custom
of making such an offer, which differs little from taking service for
wages, except that the wage has already been prepaid, may arise
almost anywhere. It is probably universal amongst civilized peoples.
The creditor soon can count on it as his right to demand his debtor&#8217;s
labour to repay the loan. He probably calculates upon it as his
security when he lends, and, if prudent, lends no more than he can
reasonably expect to be repaid in this fashion.</p>

<p>Thus far common human experience and its dictates. As a responsible
man and the head of his family, the debtor, at least among the Semites,
had power over the labour of the other members of his family. There
may be peoples where this power does not exist, if so, the power may
be called a Semitic trait. But in both the Code of Hammurabi and
the Book of the Covenant we have some reason to suppose the debtor
would have power to offer not only his own labour but that of his
wife, often the better worker of the two, or that of a son or daughter,
or of a slave, as well as or instead of his own. Exactly how far his
power over the members of his own household extended may be set
down, if we chose, as depending upon Semitic custom, if we can show
that this extent of power is common to all Semites, at any rate in
early times, and is not shared with non-Semitic folk. The parallels
in Roman law do show that it did not remain exclusively Semitic,
unless it be held that the Twelve Tables were so influenced by Eastern
civilization as to have derived this feature ultimately from a Semitic
source. It was probably Sumerian also, but there we may perhaps
derive it from an early Semitic source. At any rate we do find it
common to both Babylonia and Israel, whether they derived it from
a common source or obtained it independently.</p>

<p>Now how long shall the debtor or his hostage serve the creditor to
pay off the debt? The creditor might well say in the case of a slave,
who in practice was often taken as an antichretic pledge for a loan,
his labour being supposed to pay the interest on the loan without
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
affecting the capital, that he had a right to keep him always.
Theoretically this was true if the loan was about the value of the
slave. It would practically be accepting the slave as a payment of
the loan. The value of a slave was often very little in excess of the
cost of keeping him, feeding, clothing, and housing him. Indeed, he
was even an anxiety after he became adult. The owner usually did
wisely in providing him with a slave-girl for wife and so breeding
a family of slaves, who after they had been kept to adult age might
be sold profitably. But even this was a speculation, and at the best
not a very profitable business. The creditor who accepted the
debtors slave as a hostage for debt usually took the opportunity of
a sale to pass him on. A slave-girl had other uses than her work and
was usually more saleable. Hence she was more likely to be accepted
and offered as a hostage.</p>

<p>The Code of Hammurabi here steps in with a remarkable set of
restrictions upon the freedom of action of the debtor and creditor.
The debtor cannot complain if the creditor sells the slave given him
as hostage. But if it is a slave-girl who has borne children to the
debtor, she cannot be sold. She may be pledged or given to work off
a debt, but not alienated by the creditor (&sect; 118).</p>

<p>If the debtor has handed over wife, son, or daughter as hostage,
they have to be treated as freemen still. They are not to forfeit
freedom for ever. The Code orders their release at the end of three
years&#8217; service. It is a noteworthy interference with the above power
of a man over his family (&sect; 116), Semitic or not. In such cases as
these there is no account whatever taken of the amount of debt. It
is an arbitrary interference on the part of a lawgiver with commercial
principles, or selfish instinct, in favour of the weak against the strong.
It seems clearly to be an innovation, for though earlier kings had
declared amnesty from debt on special occasions, that was a more
primitive measure of pity and a generous use of other men&#8217;s money
peculiarly unfair to the soft-hearted lender. This was a bold, calculated
move in the direction of humane regulation. It had its risks of
abuse, and if Hammurabi had stopped there, he might have done
more harm than good. For he would have left it open to the hard-hearted
creditor to try and exact more work, the utmost farthing in
fact, out of his temporary slave. Accordingly he declared that if the
hostage for debt died of blows or want in the creditor&#8217;s house, the
creditor should suffer the same family bereavement as he had brought
on the debtor by his cruelty, a regulation which might lead the
creditor&#8217;s family to moderate his exactions, or forfeit the average
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
price of the slave he killed by ill use, and, what the creditor would
feel most keenly of all, lose all further claim on the debtor.</p>

<p>Now by such regulations Hammurabi set a very effective limit on
two markedly Oriental vices. Men love to gamble by borrowing for
present enjoyment on security of some contingent future wealth.
They pledge crops, land, houses, family with gleeful irresponsibility.
But others are avaricious and only too willing to lend on decent
security or even most speculative future profit. Hammurabi&#8217;s
Amorites and Babylonians were by no means above these abuses.
He forbade speculation in crops, &amp;c., and by his regulations on these
points put a very stringent restraint on debt. The debtor&#8217;s powers of
borrowing were greatly narrowed. A prudent lender found himself
checked by the consideration that if the debtor did not pay he would
never be able to reclaim more than three years&#8217; average work out
of the debtor, his wife, son, or daughter. He would have a shrewd
guess at what these assets were worth. So the lawgiver cut at the
root of much of the misery which his predecessors tried to redress by
their slap-dash amnesty.</p>

<p>We do well to remember that a respectable, pious, poor man in
Babylonia could usually borrow from his local temple without
interest, and that by the Code agricultural loans could not be pressed
if the crop failed. Hence we see that most of the debts which
Hammurabi made so difficult must have been due to improvidence,
laziness, or a weak use of the facility to borrow offered by wealthy,
lazy, and avaricious money-lenders.</p>

<p>The Hebrew legislation on the subject is precisely similar save
that the term is six years. Whether three or six, the term is so
absolutely arbitrary that no possible explanation can be given to
account for it. It equally ignores the amount of debt, the value
of the debtor&#8217;s work, and the sacredness of contract. Had both
legislations hit upon a three years&#8217; term, we might have racked our
brains to find a reason why in the world three years should have
commended itself to both lawgivers. We should have been tempted
to think that these Semites had some sanctity about the term which
made it appropriate to select. At any rate we should have wondered
what a money-lender in Israel had done to deserve to get twice
as much work for his money as the Babylonian. Some might even
have been tempted to see early evidence of Jewish aptitude for
business. Others would doubtless begin to play with the importance
of the value seven to the Jewish mind. Then one would begin
to see the influence of P. as in the first chapter of Genesis. Unfortunately
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
the Babylonians of the Hammurabi period had about as much
reverence for seven as for three, and perhaps as much for both as the
Israelite in the Book of the Covenant.</p>

<p>But it is a poor compliment to a lawgiver of any age to suppose
that sacred numbers influenced the nature of his laws. Doubtless
the Jubilee release was economically an advance on sporadic amnesty,
but to make a debtor&#8217;s lot twice as hard and a money-lender&#8217;s security
double, especially as there is no reason to suppose that in Israel the
temple was the poor man&#8217;s bank, all for sake of seven is not a fair
charge against Moses or any lawgiver unless it is absolutely certain.
The change from three to six is not easy to account for on scientific
sociological grounds.</p>

<p>But one of the Hebrew Scriptures does attempt to account for the
change, and evidently regards it as a change to be accounted for.
The Deuteronomic writer argues that the creditor ought not to deem
it hard that he should release his debtor at the end of six years
because he had so served a double term. We may note that as it now
stands the text says &#8216;double the hire of a hireling&#8217;. That is purely
irrelevant. A slave&#8217;s value was surely less to the holder, not more
than that of a hireling, for his keep had to be subtracted, and his work
was hardly likely to be so valuable as that of a freeman. The profit
of a hireling is the excess of the value of his work above what is paid
for it. The hire of a hireling was surely not just half the value of
his own work or of a slave&#8217;s work. Indeed, it is not easy to see
what the double of a hireling&#8217;s hire has to do with the question. The
writer was right in saying the term of six years was double something,
and there can be no question that it was double three years, and
therefore double the term fixed by Hammurabi five hundred or more
years before. The creditor seems to have resented letting the debtor
go at all, at any rate till he had worked off all his debt. The writer
clearly knew that the creditor had already obtained twice what he had
to expect under other circumstances, and believed he would admit the
fact. It was double the Babylonian allowance.</p>

<p>Can this undesigned coincidence be accidental? Is either Semitic
custom or human experience competent to explain the significance of
the doubleness being pointed out in this way?</p>

<p>If Canaanite custom before the Exodus had a term of three years&#8217;
service in such cases, the same as the Hammurabi Code, surely that
was due to Babylonian law, unless, as some would maintain, the
Amorite dynasty to which Hammurabi belonged really came from
Canaan, in which case Hammurabi imposed Canaanite law on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Babylonia. It was a non-essential, anyway; it could nowhere have
been the outcome of special circumstances likely to occur again. It
was not a creditor&#8217;s law, for he obviously wanted liberty to keep the
debtor&#8217;s hostage till he had satisfied his own desires; it was not
a debtor&#8217;s law, for he would have surely preferred the three years&#8217;
limit. It was a concession to the creditor to meet that hard-hearted
person&#8217;s wishes.</p>

<p>It is not the large stock of common matter in the two legislations
about a hostage for debt but the disguised yet undeniable adaptation
which seems so significant.</p>

<p>Let us now consider another somewhat different case. Death
by burning is a horrible punishment, and was so recognized by the
later Jewish lawyers, who contrived a legal fiction to do away with its
literal infliction even on the scandalous criminals for whom it was
intended. Hammurabi orders it twice. It would be very difficult to
account by common Semitic custom or evolutionary methods for its
being inflicted, if at all, only twice. Yet the laws of Moses inflict it
twice also. If these arose independently, what is there from any
intelligible point of view to demand its infliction at all&mdash;but, if at all,
why twice and only twice? And that too in laws so similar?</p>

<p>Well now, in both laws the incest of mother and son is one case.
The heinousness of that crime may suffice to justify the hideous
penalty. Hammurabi (&sect;&sect; 157-8) clearly distinguishes incest with
a man&#8217;s own mother and with a step-mother. Leviticus (xx. 14;
xxi. 9) makes a curious specification of the case; whether to include
other cases or not is not very clear. But evidently this great crime
met the same unique punishment.</p>

<p>Hammurabi&#8217;s second case is that of a votary, or vestal virgin, who
left her cloister to open a wine shop or frequent it for strong drink.
At first sight we might regard this as a protest against a vestal&#8217;s
intemperance solely. But women did keep wine shops, and their
conduct of them is regulated by the Code. We may recall the case
of Rahab in Joshua ii. 1. The second case in Hebrew law is
Lev. xxi. 9: the priest&#8217;s daughter who is unchaste is to be burned
with fire. Now why are other women of the priest&#8217;s family not
included? Is priest&#8217;s daughter to be taken, like the <i>m&acirc;rat am&ecirc;lim</i> in
the Code, to mean a woman of the priestly family? Or is it simply
a priestess? Surely it is just a periphrasis, perhaps once a gloss
on a word become obsolete, for a vowed woman like Jephthah&#8217;s
daughter. There is at first sight not much likeness between the two
second cases. But this one evidently puzzled the Jewish commentators,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
who probably had a traditional knowledge of the real meaning.
First Josephus explains the crime not as mere unchastity but as
&#8216;opening a tavern&#8217;. Was he thinking of Rahab the tavern-keeper
who was also a harlot? Or had he an inkling that the crime was the
same as Hammurabi had in view? The association of the tavern
with immorality was close in Old Testament ideas. Perhaps Hammurabi
also had it in mind, for unchastity would be specially revolting
in a vestal virgin. Surely the priest&#8217;s daughter also was a votary.
The Rabbis of the Talmud evidently suspected something disguised
in the text, for they make a comment upon it which is truly surprising
if the text be taken literally. They ask, Shall not a priestess or
priest&#8217;s daughter be treated better than a tavern-keeper? They too
knew that in some cases a tavern-keeper had to be burned. We ask,
Why and where, if she were not also a vowed woman and in the
Hammurabi Code? We need not assume that either Josephus
or they had read or heard of Hammurabi&#8217;s Code, or would have
regarded it with anything but detestation if they had. All the more
suggestive is it that these learned men should regard the verse as
meaning just what that Code did mean.</p>

<p>These points are like the meaningless but obviously Egyptian
symbols, often used for decorative purposes on seals, found in Syrian
or Hittite seals, which show the influence of the Nile and are never
disputed as due to copying, though no longer understood and used for
decorative purposes solely.</p>

<p>Some scholars are inclined to attach even more importance to the
singular likenesses in literary form, and above all to the disposition of
both the Code and the Book of the Covenant in groups of five or ten.</p>

<p>It may be remembered in this connexion that according to the
author of the Acts of the Apostles Moses was traditionally learned in
all the learning of the Egyptians. Taking that statement as literally
true, we now know from the Tell-el-Amarna tablets that that learning
included the knowledge of cuneiform at least on the part of some
Egyptian scribes before the Exodus. Philo tells us that Moses was
also learned in the learning of the Assyrians who were correspondents
of Egypt in the same period, of the Babylonians who wrote to the same
kings at the same time, and the Chaldeans, who were then known as
an independent kingdom in the Southern Sea lands of Babylonia.
These and similar traditions are usually dismissed by critics as mere
senseless attempts to enhance the reputation of Moses for wisdom and
knowledge, which included that of the wisest nations of antiquity.
But in view of what we have seen already may there not have been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
a different reason for these claims? Did not these learned men, who
themselves knew much of that knowledge, recognize in the Books of
Moses many startling parallels to the wisdom of Babylonia? Was it
not the only acceptable way to account for such parallels to assert
boldly that Moses did know these things, but in such a way that,
guided by God, he used them so far as they were in accordance with
Divine revelation; independently indeed as exercising his own discretion
in selecting from them, but dependently in so far as they had
found out already by man&#8217;s wisdom or the light of nature that which
was good and of good report?</p>

<h2>APPENDIX: SURVEY OF THE BIBLIOGRAPHY OF THE LITERATURE
RELATING TO THE CODE OF HAMMURABI.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">I. Anticipations of a Babylonian Code of Laws.</span></h3>

<p>In 1890, <span class="smcap">F. E. Peiser</span> published in his thesis <i>Iurisprudentiae Babylonicae
quae supersunt</i> (C&ouml;then, P. Schettler&#8217;s Erben) a number of fragments of
Babylonian Codes of Laws, and aptly illustrated them by relevant legal
documents. In 1902, <span class="smcap">Br. Meissner</span> published what proved to be some
fragments of the Code of Hammurabi, from copies made for Ashurbanipal&#8217;s
Library at Nineveh, now preserved in the British Museum. These
appeared in the Third Volume of the <i>Beitr&auml;ge zur Assyriologie</i> (Leipzig,
Hinrichs, 1898), under the title <i>Altbabylonische Gesetze</i> (pp. 473-523), and
were commented upon by <span class="smcap">Fr. Delitzsch</span> in the next volume (pp. 78-87)
in an article entitled <i>Zur juristischen Litteratur Babyloniens</i> and regarded
as <i>Bruchst&uuml;cke eines altbabylonischen b&uuml;rgerlichen Gesetzbuchs</i>. Judging
from the early forms of words and the old Babylonian measures used in
these texts the writer called the laws the Code Hammourabi (1902). In
his lecture before the German Emperor, which created so much stir in
theological circles and excited such general interest in Germany and
then over the whole world, <span class="smcap">Fr. Delitzsch</span> stated that Hammurabi, after
his conquest of Elam and expulsion of the Elamite power from Babylonia,
was able to promulgate a great <i>Gesetzessammlung</i>, which should unify the
civilizations of the united kingdom and fix the <i>b&uuml;rgerliche Recht</i> in all
essential points. <i>Babel und Bibel</i> (Leipzig, Hinrichs, p. 25, 1902:
delivered Jan. 13).</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">II. The Actual Code</span></h3>

<p>was first published by <span class="smcap">V. Scheil</span> in the Fourth Volume of the <i>M&eacute;moires
de la D&eacute;l&eacute;gation en Perse</i>, pp. 11-162, with transcriptions, translation, and
some notes (Paris, E. Leroux, 1902). Fragments of a second example of
the Stele were also given by <span class="smcap">V. Scheil</span> in the Tenth Volume of the
<i>M&eacute;moires</i>, pp. 81-84 (1908).</p>

<p>All subsequent editions of the text are based upon this edition. The
original monument being now in the Louvre at Paris and a superb cast
of it in the Babylonian Room of the British Museum, it is open to any
competent scholar to appreciate the extraordinary accuracy of <span class="smcap">V. Scheil</span>&#8217;s
work. The transcription and translation have naturally been somewhat
improved by the intensive study devoted to them by the many scholars
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
who have worked upon the text, especially as the result of comparison
with the contemporary legal documents. But the highest praise must
be awarded to the genius which so successfully accomplished such
a task as that of editing an entirely new text involving so many new
words and expressions and such unexpected subjects.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Re-editions of the Cuneiform Text itself.</span></h3>

<p>Having published an important article on <i>The Chirography of the
Hammurabi Code</i> in the <i>American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures</i>,
vol. xx, pp. 137-48 (Chicago University Press, 1904), <span class="smcap">R. F. Harper</span>
proceeded to issue a revised edition of the cuneiform text, with a transcription,
a new translation, vocabulary, indexes, and list of signs, under
the title <i>The Code of Hammurabi</i> (Chicago University Press, 1904), which
forms a most convenient student&#8217;s handbook for English readers.</p>

<p>In 1909, <span class="smcap">A. Ungnad</span> published <i>Keilschrifttexte der Gesetze Hammurapis,
Autographie der Stele sowie der altbabylonischen, assyrischen und neubabylonischen
Fragmente</i> (Leipzig, Hinrichs).</p>

<p><i>Codex Hammurabi. Textus primigenius, transcriptio, translatio, Latina,
vocabularia, tabula comparationis inter leges Mosis et Hammurabi. Ad usum
privatum auditorum</i>, by <span class="smcap">A. Deimel</span> (Rome, Vatican Press, 1910), has the
advantage of a language specially fitted to rendering exactly the turns of
expression occurring in the original.</p>

<p>There are some fragments of a copy found at Nippur, now preserved
in the Museum at Constantinople, copied by <span class="smcap">St. Langdon</span>, and noticed by
him and <span class="smcap">V. Scheil</span> in <i>Comptes rendus de l&#8217;Acad&eacute;mie des Inscriptions</i> (Paris,
A. Picard), 1912, p. 159, as <i>Tablette du Mus&eacute;e de Constantinople contenant les
&sect;&sect; 145-80 du Code de Hammourabi</i>; and there are other still unpublished
copies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. Poebel</span>, in the <i>Museum Journal of the Philadelphia Museum</i>, vol. iv,
no. 2, 1913, pp. 49-50, announces a further copy of the Code from
Nippur, which also supplies some of the missing laws. The fine picture
of this tablet shows its present state.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">III. Transcriptions and Translations.</span></h3>

<p>Many works appeared which took <span class="smcap">V. Scheil</span>&#8217;s transcription and translation
as sufficient, only varying from it where the author was already
possessed of independent knowledge, or had worked over the text with
a view to improve the renderings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. Winckler</span>, in November, 1902, set out <i>Die Gesetze Hammurabis,
K&ouml;nigs von Babylon um 2250 v. Chr.</i> as Part 4 of Volume IV of <i>Der alte
Orient</i> (Leipzig, Hinrichs), a complete translation with valuable introduction
and short useful notes. It was followed by a second and third
revised editions in March and November, 1903, which called the Code
<i>Das &auml;lteste Gesetzbuch der Welt</i>. In 1904 appeared a fuller work
by the same author, <i>Die Gesetze Hammurabis, Umschrift und &Uuml;bersetzung,</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
<i>dazu Einleitung, W&ouml;rter-, Eigennamen-Verzeichnis, die sogenannten
sumerischen Familiengesetze und die Gesetztafel, Brit. Mus.</i>, 82-7-14, 988.
This was a most valuable work, and has been liberally made use of
by subsequent writers (Leipzig, Hinrichs).</p>

<p>In 1903 <span class="smcap">D. H. M&uuml;ller</span> delivered lectures on the Code embodied in
<i>Vorl&auml;ufige Mitteilungen &uuml;ber die Gesetze des Hammurabi</i>, published in the
<i>Anzeiger der philosophisch-historischen Classe der K. K. Akademie der Wissenschaften
zu Wien</i>, vol. xiv, and in the <i>X. Jahresbericht der israelitisch-theologischen
Lehranstalt in Wien</i>, 1903, issued <i>Die Gesetze Hammurabis
und die mosaische Gesetzgebung</i>, afterwards published as a separate work
(Vienna, A. H&ouml;lder, 1903), with some additions. It contained not only
a transcription, but a remarkable translation into Hebrew, which did
much to bring out the likeness to the laws of Moses, and made the Code
accessible to a variety of deeply interested readers who would have
missed the point of a transcription, or even of a translation into modern
German. It was severely attacked by <span class="smcap">Kohler</span> and <span class="smcap">Peiser</span> in the <i>Deutsche
Literatur-Zeitung</i>, 1904, no. 5. <span class="smcap">M&uuml;ller</span> replied in no. 8, where <span class="smcap">Kohler</span>
answered him. <span class="smcap">M&uuml;ller</span>, however, made many acute suggestions as to
the Babylonian text, as well as the subject-matter, and his views have
received continued support. His comparison with the other ancient
codes, especially with the books of Moses and the Roman Twelve Tables,
was full of fresh matter and well deserves careful study.</p>

<p>In 1904 was published what promised to be an epoch-making work.
<span class="smcap">J. Kohler</span>, Professor of Comparative Law in the University of Berlin,
brought his unrivalled knowledge of ancient laws to bear on the legal
side of the Code; and <span class="smcap">F. E. Peiser</span>, so well versed in Babylonian Legal
Documents (see p. <a href="#Page_83">83</a>, below), who had worked with <span class="smcap">Kohler</span> before,
attempted an improved translation. The work appeared as Band I of
<i>Hammurabi&#8217;s Gesetze</i>, and contained <i>&Uuml;bersetzung, juristische Wiedergabe,
Erl&auml;uterung</i> (Leipzig, Pfeiffer). Band II was to contain philological
researches, a transcription with a grammatical and lexicographical treatment.
Band III was to be an <i>Urkundenbuch</i>, to give a selection of the
more important documents of the Hammurabi period so as to form
a contemporary commentary. In many points <span class="smcap">Peiser</span>, or his translation,
misled <span class="smcap">Kohler</span>, and the work was vigorously attacked by <span class="smcap">D. H. M&uuml;ller</span>
as <i>Die Kohler-Peisersche Hammurabi-&Uuml;bersetzung</i> in the <i>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r die
Privat-und &Ouml;ffentlichen Rechte der Gegenwart</i>, Bd. xxxi (Wien, H&ouml;lder, 1904).
<span class="smcap">M. Schorr</span> also contributed an article on <i>Die Kohler-Peisersche Hammurabi-&Uuml;bersetzung</i>
to the <i>Wiener Zeitschrift f&uuml;r die Kunde des Morgenlandes</i>,
vol. xviii, pp. 208-40, with a long series of acute and severe criticisms. We
may note here <span class="smcap">M&uuml;ller</span>&#8217;s <i>Zur Hammurabi-Kritik</i> in <i>Zeitschrift der Deutschen
Morgenl&auml;ndischen Gesellschaft</i>, lix, pp. 145-9, <span class="smcap">Zimmern</span>&#8217;s article under same
title, same place, pp. 150-4, and <span class="smcap">M&uuml;ller</span>&#8217;s article with the same title in
<i>Wiener Zeitschrift f&uuml;r die Kunde des Morgenlandes</i>, xix, pp. 371-88, carrying
on a controversy which cleared up some points. In this great work
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">A. Ungnad</span> became associated with <span class="smcap">Kohler</span>, and to him is due the
<i>Umschrift</i> published as Band II with a complete glossary of the Code,
and an <i>Anhang</i> with a register of the duplicates then known, Old
Babylonian, Assyrian, and Neo-Babylonian, which were used to complete
the text (Leipzig, Pfeiffer, 1909).</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">IV. Translations Alone.</span></h3>

<p>Of translations there was early no lack. <span class="smcap">Scheil</span>&#8217;s appeared in October,
1902, <span class="smcap">Winckler</span>&#8217;s first, the following month. <i>The Oldest Code of Laws in
the World</i>, a baldly literal translation of the Code alone, with a short
introduction and index of subjects by <span class="smcap">C. H. W. Johns</span>, appeared in
February, 1903 (T. &amp; T. Clark, Edinburgh).</p>

<p><i>Le leggi di Hammurabi re di Babilonia (a. 2285-2242 a. C.) con prefazione
e note</i>, by <span class="smcap">P. Bonfante</span> (Milano, 1903), and <i>Il codice di Hammurabi e la
Bibbia</i>, by <span class="smcap">Fr. Mari</span> (Roma, Descl&eacute;e, 1903), witness to the interest shown
in Italy.</p>

<p>In the <i>New York Independent</i> for December 11, 18, 1902, and January
8, 15, 22, 1903, <span class="smcap">W. Hayes Ward</span> gave a translation of the Code, following
<span class="smcap">Winckler</span> closely; as did <span class="smcap">C. F. Kent</span> in his article, <i>The Recently Discovered
Civil Code of Hammurabi</i>, published in the <i>Biblical World</i> (Chicago
University Press, March, 1903).</p>

<p>A translation of the Code also appeared in <span class="smcap">W. St. Chad Boscawen</span>&#8217;s
<i>The First of Empires</i>, along with comments and notes. The book presented
a clear and readable account of the life and times of Hammurabi
and the dynasty to which he belonged. It gave many interesting views
upon Babylonian history and the relations to Israelite legislation; but it
must be used with great caution, as it is often inaccurate and full of
misprints (London and New York, Harper&#8217;s, 1903).</p>

<p>The many criticisms which had appeared on his first translation and
the desirability of a less expensive presentation led <span class="smcap">V. Scheil</span>, in 1903, to
put out a fresh translation as <i>La loi de Hammurabi</i> (Paris, E. Leroux); in
which, however, he accepted little from his critics. A second edition came
out in 1904.</p>

<p>Other translations have appeared in connexion with particular discussions.
Thus the present writer was induced to set out a fresh translation
for his <i>Babylonian and Assyrian Laws, Contracts, and Letters</i> in the <i>Library
of Ancient Inscriptions</i> (Edinburgh, T. &amp; T. Clark, 1904). This work
covered most of the helps to the study of the subjects referred to in this
survey available up to that date. <span class="smcap">R. W. Rogers</span> included an excellent
translation and transliteration of the text in his useful work, <i>Cuneiform
Parallels to the Old Testament</i> (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1912).</p>

<p>Several of those who have discussed the relation of the Code to the
laws of Moses have given translations based upon <span class="smcap">Scheil</span>, <span class="smcap">Winckler</span>, or
<span class="smcap">M&uuml;ller</span>. <i>The Hammurabi Code and the Sinaitic Legislation</i>, by <span class="smcap">Chilperic
Edwards</span> (London, Watts &amp; Co., 1904), <i>The Codes of Hammurabi and</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
<i>Moses</i>, <span class="smcap">W. W. Davies</span> (New York, Eaton &amp; Maine, 1905), <i>The Code of
Hammurabi</i>, by <span class="smcap">C. H. W. Johns</span>, in the Extra Volume of <i>A Dictionary of
the Bible</i> (Edinburgh, T. &amp; T. Clark, 1904), pp. 584-612, may be named.
In the second and third editions of his excellent work, <i>The Old Testament
in the Light of the Historical Records and Legends of Assyria and
Babylonia</i> (London, S. P. C. K., 1903), <span class="smcap">T. G. Pinches</span> translated the Code
(1903, pp. 487-536; 1908, pp. 487-538). The treatment is full of acute
observation and accurate scholarship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. Ungnad</span> has contributed a fresh translation to <i>Altorientalische Texte
und Bilder zum alten Testamente, herausgegeben von</i> <span class="smcap">H. Gressmann</span>, <i>erster
Band</i>, pp. 140-71 (T&uuml;bingen, J. C. B. Mohr, 1909).</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">V. Discussions.</span></h3>

<p>All the above works contained more or less discussion of the Code
from various points of view.</p>

<p>In October, 1902, the present writer read a paper before the <i>Cambridge
Theological Society</i>, an abstract of which appeared in the January number
of the <i>Journal of Theological Studies</i> (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1903). The
Code was here dealt with as <i>material for comparison with the Laws of Moses</i>,
but no comparison was made. <span class="smcap">A. Ungnad</span> wrote <i>Zur Syntax der Gesetze
Hammurabis</i> in vol. xvii of the <i>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Assyriologie</i>, pp. 353-78
(Strassburg, K. J. Tr&uuml;bner, May, 1903), and again in vol. xviii, pp. 1-67.
The text of the Code, by its careful phraseology and exact use of
grammatical forms, has become a classic for the study of the language.
The order of the sentence is, however, somewhat unusual, and probably
shows the influence of the legal phraseology of the time, which was
based on Sumerian law precedents. <span class="smcap">D. H. M&uuml;ller</span> took up this point
in <i>Die Wortfolge bei Hammurabi und die sumerische Frage</i>, an article in
<i>Wiener Zeitschrift f&uuml;r die Kunde des Morgenlandes</i>, vol. xvii, pp. 337-42
(Wien, H&ouml;lder, 1904), followed by <i>Noch einmal die Wortfolge bei Hammurabi
und die sumerische Frage</i>, vol. xviii, pp. 89-94. <i>Der Gebrauch der
Modi in den Gesetzen Hammurabis</i>, xviii, pp. 95-8, by <span class="smcap">D. H. M&uuml;ller</span>,
appeared in the <i>Wiener Zeitschrift f&uuml;r die Kunde des Morgenlandes</i> (Vienna,
A. H&ouml;lder, 1904).</p>

<p>In the <i>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Assyriologie</i>, vol. xviii, pp. 202-22, <span class="smcap">S. Daiches</span>
contributed a most important article, <i>Zur Erkl&auml;rung des Hammurabi-Codex</i>
(1904). The same title was used by <span class="smcap">A. Ungnad</span> for an article in the
<i>Wissenschaftliches Correspondenzblatt der Philologie&mdash;Novitates</i> for October,
1906, pp. 8-9.</p>

<p>In vol. xix of the <i>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Assyriologie</i>, pp. 388-91, <span class="smcap">Chr. Sarauw</span>
took up the grammar of the Code in an article <i>Zum Kasus-System des
Hammurabi-Kodex</i>, 1906.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. Wohlframm</span> has since written <i>Untersuchungen zur Syntax des Codex
Hammurabis</i> (Leipzig, Drugulin, 1910).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>In the <i>Expository Times</i>, vol. xiv, pp. 257-8, the present writer gave an
article on the <i>Code of Hammurabi</i>, and in <i>The Journal of Theological
Studies</i>, vol. v, pp. 313-16, under the same title, a notice of the bibliography
at that date. <span class="smcap">A. W. Sayce</span> wrote on <i>The Laws of Hammurabi</i>, <i>Expository
Times</i>, vol. xv, pp. 184-6. <i>The Code of King Hammurabi</i> appeared in
<i>The Times</i>, April 14, 1903; <i>The Laws of Hammurabi</i>, by <span class="smcap">L. T. Hobhouse</span>,
in <i>The Speaker</i>, March 7, 1903; <span class="smcap">D. O. Dykes</span> in <i>The Juridical Review</i>,
discussed some legal points; <span class="smcap">E. K&ouml;nig</span> gave an estimate in <i>Beweis des
Glaubens</i>, 1903, pp. 169-80. <span class="smcap">P. Lotichius</span> wrote <i>Die Gesetzessammlung
des K&ouml;nigs Hammurabi von Babylon</i> in <i>Protestantenblatt</i>, 1903, nos. 29, 30.
<span class="smcap">C. F. Lehmann</span> contributed an article on <i>Hammurabi&#8217;s Code</i> to <i>The
Nineteenth Century</i>, 1903, pp. 1035-44. These served to give a wider
publicity to the Code.</p>

<p>In <i>Notes on the Hammurabi Monument</i>, <i>Journal of the American Oriental
Society</i>, vol. xxv, pp. 266-78, <span class="smcap">D. G. Lyon</span>, 1904 (New Haven, Conn.),
and in <i>Notes on the Code of Hammurabi</i>, <i>American Journal of Semitic
Languages and Literatures</i>, vol. xxii, pp. 1-28, <span class="smcap">R. F. Harper</span> (Chicago,
University Press, 1905) made some important contributions to the understanding
of the text. <span class="smcap">D. H. M&uuml;ller</span> wrote <i>Ueber die Gesetze Hammurabis</i>
(Wien, H&ouml;lder, 1904); <span class="smcap">T. G. Pinches</span> had an article <i>Hammurabi&#8217;s Code
of Laws</i> in the <i>Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology</i>, 1902,
pp. 301-8, among other valuable comments pointing out a hitherto
unrecognized fragment in Ashurbanipal&#8217;s Library. The present writer
discussed some difficulties in <i>Notes on the Code of Hammurabi</i> contributed
to the <i>American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literature</i>, vol. xix,
pp. 96-107, 172-5 (Chicago, University Press, 1903); <span class="smcap">T. G. Pinches</span>
wrote also on <i>The Laws of the Babylonians as recorded in the Code of
Hammurabi</i> in <i>The Journal of the Victoria Institute</i>, 1903, pp. 237-55.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P. Cruveilhier</span> discussed <i>Le Code de Hammurabi</i> in <i>Revue du Clerg&eacute;
fran&ccedil;ais</i>, 1912, pp. 413 ff.</p>

<p>There is not space to chronicle all the reviews of these books and
articles on the Code, though many of them are practically articles in
themselves and marked advances. As a rule, later books used up all
that appeared in the reviews of any note, and some of them give
references to such sources. Such discussions are of fundamental importance
for the exact understanding of the Code.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Separate Sections.</span></h3>

<p>Many discussions arose as to the meaning of particular sections. Thus
<span class="smcap">C F. Lehmann(-Haupt)</span> wrote in <i>Klio</i>, vol. iii, pp. 32-41 (1904), on <i>Ein
missverstandenes Gesetz Hammurabis</i>, which was also taken as the title of
an article by <span class="smcap">F. E. Peiser</span> in <i>Orientalistische Litteraturzeitung</i>, vol. vii, cols.
236-7 (1904). Neither of these scholars can be said to have quite settled
the questions they had raised; but the subject of &sect;&sect; 185-93 was greatly
cleared by their thoughtful treatment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1908 <span class="smcap">M. Schorr</span> contributed to the <i>Wiener Zeitschrift f&uuml;r die Kunde
des Morgenlandes</i>, vol. xxii, pp. 385-92, an article on <i>Die &sect;&sect; 280-282 des
Gesetzbuches Hammurabis</i>, followed, pp. 393-8, by an article of <span class="smcap">D. H.
M&uuml;ller</span> on <i>Die &sect;&sect; 280-282 des Kodex Hammurabis</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. Schorr</span> in 1906 had written in the same journal, vol. xx, pp. 119-23,
an article <i>Zum &sect; 27 des Hammurabi-Gesetzes</i>, and in the <i>Vienna Oriental
Journal</i>, xx (1906), pp. 314-36, <i>Der &sect; 7 des Hammurabi-Gesetzes</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Br. Meissner</span> has discussed the correct word for a builder in the Code
in the <i>Orientalistische Litteraturzeitung</i>, vol. xv, cols. 38-59 (1912), under
the title <i>Zu Hammurapis Gesetz</i>, xix, R. 93.</p>

<p><i>Die L&uuml;cke in der Gesetzes-Stele Hammurapis</i>, by <span class="smcap">A. Ungnad</span>, in the <i>Beitr&auml;ge
zur Assyriologie</i>, vi, Heft 5, discussed all the means known to fill the gap
as existing in the text, but the new sources named on p. 66 above will
very likely suffice to complete the text.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Structure of the Code.</span></h3>

<p>Considerable weight may ultimately have to be laid on the grouping of the
laws by &#8216;tens&#8217; or &#8216;fives&#8217;. This aspect had been discussed by <span class="smcap">D. G. Lyon</span>
in the <i>Journal of the American Oriental Society</i>, vol. xxv, pp. 248-65, as
<i>The Structure of the Hammurabi Code</i> (New Haven, Conn., 1904).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. F. Kent</span> in his excellent work on <i>Israel&#8217;s Laws and Legal Precedents</i>
(London, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1907) makes considerable use of a
division of Hebrew laws into groups of five or ten, of which the Ten
Commandments forms a well-known example. Whether or no these
divisions command general assent, we should notice that <span class="smcap">D. G. Lyon</span>
finds repeated evidence of the same grouping in the Code of Hammurabi.
This naturally cannot be pressed too far as evidence of dependence.
But it is surely non-essential that laws should be arranged in pentads
unless we are to suppose that a reference to five fingers as a method of
recalling the separate clauses is involved, and would be natural to
expect in such cases. But that Israelite fondness for the number seven,
shown in their seven-day week as against the Babylonian week of five days,
or their partiality for other sacred numbers, did not affect the numbering
of the laws may well be significant. If it turn out that these groups of
five also correspond in contents, even though they show traces of change,
we have a strong argument for dependence which supports any others
pointing in the same direction.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Place of the Code in Comparative Law.</span></h3>

<p>As early as October and November, 1902, there appeared <i>Le Code
Babylonien d&#8217;Hammourabi</i> in the <i>Journal des Savants</i> (Paris, Hachette), by
<span class="smcap">R. Dareste</span>, giving a luminous account of the subject-matter of the Code,
illustrating it by comparison with a number of ancient legislations. He,
of course, based his conclusions entirely upon <span class="smcap">Scheil&#8217;s</span> translation, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
his work still remains most valuable. In 1903 appeared <span class="smcap">Schmersahl&#8217;s</span>
<i>Das &auml;lteste Gesetzbuch der Welt: Die Gesetze Hammurabis</i> in the <i>Deutsche
Juristen-Zeitung</i>, pp. 111 ff. <span class="smcap">R. Dareste</span> also published <i>Le Code Babylonien
d&#8217;Hammourabi</i> in the <i>Nouvelle Revue historique de droit fran&ccedil;ais et &eacute;tranger</i>
(Paris, Larose, January and February, 1903). <i>Hammurapi und das Salische
Recht</i>, by <span class="smcap">H. Fehr</span> (Bonn, Marcus &amp; Weber, 1910), is a very remarkable
study.</p>

<p>A first-rate work was <span class="smcap">G. Cohn&#8217;s</span> lecture, <i>Die Gesetze Hammurabis</i> (Z&uuml;rich,
F&uuml;ssli, 1903). <span class="smcap">Kohler</span> and <span class="smcap">M&uuml;ller</span> (see pp. 67, 69) have to be weighed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. Stooss</span> in his article <i>Das babylonische Strafrecht Hammurabis, Schweizerische
Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Strafrecht</i>, vol. xvi (Basel, Georg, 1903), took up the
question of &#8216;Crimes and Punishments&#8217;, on which see also the article with
that title by <span class="smcap">T. G. Pinches</span> in <i>The Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics</i>,
iv, pp. 256 ff.; and <i>Imprisonment</i>, by the same author, iv, pp. 260 ff.
<i>Die peinlichen Strafen im Kriegs-und Rechtswesen der Babylonier und Assyrer</i>,
by <span class="smcap">J. Jelitto</span> (Breslau, 1913), adds considerably to the subject. Compare
also <i>Zum &auml;ltesten Strafrecht der Kulturv&ouml;lker</i>, by <span class="smcap">Th. Mommsen</span> and others
(Leipzig, Duncker, 1905).</p>

<p>The judicial procedure remains in many points obscure despite the fine
<i>Essai sur l&#8217;organisation judiciaire de la Chald&eacute;e &agrave; l&#8217;&eacute;poque de la premi&egrave;re
dynastie babylonienne</i>, by <span class="smcap">Ed. Cuq</span>, in the <i>Revue d&#8217;Assyriologie</i>, 1910,
pp. 65-101, which records most known facts; <i>Commentaire juridique d&#8217;un
jugement sous Ammiditana</i>, by the same author in the same journal, 1910,
pp. 129-38; and again <i>Un proc&egrave;s criminel &agrave; Babylone sous le r&egrave;gne de
Samsou-iluna</i>, 1911, pp. 173-81. <span class="smcap">P. Dhorme</span> discussed in the same
volume, p. 99, <i>Un appel sous Samsou-iluna</i>. <i>A Legal Episode in Ancient
Babylonian Family Life</i>, in the <i>Proceedings of the Society of Biblical
Archaeology</i>, 1910, pp. 81-92, 129-42, is by <span class="smcap">W. T. Pilter</span>.</p>

<p>The tenure of land was elucidated by <span class="smcap">H. Winckler</span> in <i>Zum babylonisch-chald&auml;ischen
Feudalwesen</i>, in <i>Altorientalische Forschungen</i>, i, pp. 497-503.
<i>La Propri&eacute;t&eacute; fonci&egrave;re en Chald&eacute;e</i>, by <span class="smcap">Ed. Cuq</span> (Paris, Larose, 1907), chiefly
deals with later developments; as do the articles by <i>J. OPPERT</i>, <i>Le
droit de retrait lignager &agrave; Ninive</i> in the <i>Comptes rendus</i> of the <i>Acad&eacute;mie
des inscriptions et belles-lettres</i> (Paris, 1898), and <i>Das assyrische Landrecht</i>
in the <i>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Assyriologie</i>, xiii, pp. 243-76 (Weimar, 1898).</p>

<p>The position of some classes or castes named will be dealt with under
the <span class="smcap">Lexicography of the Code</span>, pp. 74 ff. <i>The Consecrated Women of the
Hammurabi Code</i> is an important essay by <span class="smcap">D. G. Lyon</span> in the <i>Studies in
the History of Religions presented to Crawford Howell Toy</i> (New York, The
Macmillan Co., 1912), pp. 341-60. See also <i>Altbabylonische Rechtsurkunden
aus der Zeit der Hammurabi-Dynastie</i>, by <span class="smcap">S. Daiches</span> (Leipzig, Hinrichs,
1903).</p>

<p>The view of law as sworn contract has importance enough to be specially
considered. It was early discovered in the so-called contracts which
were once regarded as legal decisions. We may refer to <i>Sworn Obligations</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
<i>under Egyptian and Babylonian Law</i>, by E. and <span class="smcap">V. Revillout</span>, and <i>Sworn
Obligations in Babylonian Law</i> by the same authors in <i>The Babylonian and
Oriental Record</i>, vol. i, no. 7, and vol. ii, no. 1. <span class="smcap">A. Ungnad</span> pointed out
<i>Eine neue Form der Beglaubigung in altbabylonischen Urkunden</i> in the
<i>Orientalistische Litteraturzeitung</i>, 1906, cols. 163-4. The whole subject
was taken up by <span class="smcap">S. A. B. Mercer</span> in his dissertation on <i>The Oath in
Babylonian and Assyrian Literature</i> (Munich, 1911).</p>

<p>The idea underlying the appeal to the ordeal is closely allied to that
of the oath, and <span class="smcap">F. E. Peiser</span> wrote <i>Zum Ordal bei Babyloniern</i> in the
<i>Orientalistische Litteraturzeitung</i>, 1911, cols. 477-9.</p>

<p>The importance of the family in the Code and Babylonian Law in
general has led to several monographs. <i>Le Mariage &agrave; Babylone</i>, by
<span class="smcap">Ed. Cuq</span> (Paris, Lecoffre, 1905), and <i>Zur Terminologie im Eherecht bei
Hammurabi</i>, by <span class="smcap">D. H. M&uuml;ller</span>, in the <i>Wiener Zeitschrift f&uuml;r die Kunde des
Morgenlandes</i>, xix, pp. 352-8, deal chiefly with the Code. <span class="smcap">L. Freund&#8217;s</span>
<i>Zur Geschichte des Ehegutrechtes bei den Semiten</i> (Vienna, A. H&ouml;lder, 1909)
chiefly deals with Jewish custom. <i>Liebe und Ehe im alten Orient</i>, by
<span class="smcap">F. Freiherr von Reitzenstein</span> (Stuttgart, Franckh, 1909), devotes pp. 51
to 70 to the Babylonian side. Of course, <span class="smcap">W. Robertson Smith&#8217;s</span> <i>Kinship
and Marriage</i> will be consulted in its new edition by <span class="smcap">S. A. Cook</span> (London,
A. &amp; C. Black, 1903).</p>

<p>Closely connected are other questions as to the status of women.
Already in 1892 <span class="smcap">J. Oppert</span> was able to make out much about <i>Libert&eacute;
de la femme &agrave; Babylone</i> in the <i>Revue d&#8217;Assyriologie</i>, ii, pp. 89-90. <span class="smcap">V. Marx</span>
discussed <i>Die Stellung der Frauen in Babylonien</i> in the <i>Beitr&auml;ge zur
Assyriologie</i>, iv, pp. 1-77.</p>

<p>Slavery in Babylonia was very different from either Roman or modern
ideals. As long ago as 1888 <span class="smcap">J. Oppert</span> had made out much from the
legal documents of later times in his article <i>La condition des esclaves
&agrave; Babylone</i> in the <i>Comptes rendus</i> of the <i>Acad&eacute;mie des inscriptions et belles-lettres</i>
for that year. <span class="smcap">Br. Meissner</span> had written a dissertation in 1882,
<i>De servitute babylonico-assyriaca</i> (Leipzig), which still deserves to be
consulted. <span class="smcap">M. Schorr</span> wrote <i>Arbeitsruhetage im alten Babylonien</i> in <i>Revue
S&eacute;mitique</i>, 1912, pp. 398-9.</p>

<p>The questions of guarantee, security, &amp;c., are finely treated by
<span class="smcap">P. Koschaker</span> in his work, <i>Babylonisch-assyrisches B&uuml;rgschaftsrecht</i> (Leipzig,
Teubner, 1911).</p>

<p>Business in general is well dealt with by <span class="smcap">Fr. Delitzsch</span> in his <i>Handel
und Wandel in Altbabylonien</i> (Stuttgart, Deutsche Verlagsanstalt, 1910).
<i>Die Commenda im islamischen Rechte</i>, by <span class="smcap">J. Kohler</span> (W&uuml;rzburg, Stahel,
1885), is to be compared.</p>

<p><i>Aus dem altbabylonischen Recht</i>, by <span class="smcap">Br. Meissner</span>, in <i>Der alte Orient</i>, vii,
Heft 1, 1905 (Leipzig, Hinrichs), is excellent.</p>

<p>On the whole subject of Babylonian law a valuable treatise is
<span class="smcap">P. Koschaker&#8217;s</span> article, <i>The Scope and Methods of a History of Assyrio-Babylonian</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
<i>Laws</i> in the <i>Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology</i>,
1913, pp. 230-43. <i>Babylonian and Assyrian Laws, Contracts, and Letters</i>,
by the present writer, in <i>The Library of Ancient Inscriptions</i> (T. &amp; T. Clark,
Edinburgh, 1904), and the articles on <i>Babylonian Law</i>, by the same author,
in <i>The Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, vol. iii, 1910, may be consulted, pp. 115-21,
and in <i>The Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics</i>. The French jurist,
<span class="smcap">Ed. Cuq</span>, in his <i>Notes d&#8217;&eacute;pigraphie et de papyrologie</i>, published in the
<i>Nouvelle Revue historique du droit fran&ccedil;ais et &eacute;tranger</i> (Paris, L. Larose),
1906-1909, discussed many points of <i>Le Droit babylonien au temps de la
Premi&egrave;re Dynastie de Babylone</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Lexicography of the Code.</span></h3>

<p>Most of the discussions and editions above referred to deal with points
in the lexicography. The edition by <span class="smcap">Ungnad</span> in his Band II, named on
p. 68, gives the latest results of the investigations in this domain. A few
other works deserving of note will be added here.</p>

<p>The meaning of <i>am&ecirc;lu</i> was elucidated by <span class="smcap">H. Winckler</span> in his <i>Altorientalische
Forschungen</i>, ii, pp. 312-15, 1901 (Leipzig, Pfeiffer).</p>

<p>The difficult word <i>mushk&ecirc;nu</i>, rendered <i>noble</i> by <span class="smcap">Scheil</span> and after him
by <span class="smcap">Dareste</span> and others, was given this meaning because the fines and
penalties inflicted on him in the Code seemed to be less than those
inflicted on the ordinary man. The ideogram used in the Code was not
rendered into Semitic Babylonian by <span class="smcap">Scheil</span>, but first in print by
<span class="smcap">H. Zimmern</span>. A crowd of extraordinary guesses as to the meaning of
the term were hazarded, founded on the cognate languages. Thus it
was discussed by <span class="smcap">E. Littmann</span> in <i>Zur Bedeutung von miskên, Zeitschrift f&uuml;r
Assyriologie</i>, vol. xvii, pp. 262-5 (Strassburg, K. J. Tr&uuml;bner, 1903), who
made it out to be <i>leper</i> and by <span class="smcap">Et. Combe</span> in <i>Babyloniaca</i>, vol. iii, pp. 73-4,
who settled the meaning from its use in modern Arabic. The present
writer had already anticipated much of this in his <i>Oldest Code</i> and the
<i>Notes on the Hammurabi Code</i>, above, p. 70.</p>

<p>The meaning and status of the <i>r&icirc;dts&acirc;b&ecirc;</i> was discussed by <span class="smcap">S. Daiches</span>,
<i>Zur Erkl&auml;rung des Hammurabi-Codex</i>, in <i>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Assyriologie</i>, 1904-1905,
pp. 202-22. Many useful hints will be found in <i>Semitica: Sprach-und
rechtsvergleichende Studien</i>, in the <i>Sitzungsberichte der philosophisch-historischen
Klasse der kaiserlichen Akademie in Wien</i>, 1906, cols. 1-88
(Wien, A. H&ouml;lder).</p>

<p>The exact way in which the Semitic people of the Hammurabi period
exploited the stores of legal knowledge acquired by the Sumerians is still
much discussed. So by <span class="smcap">M. Schorr</span> in his <i>Die altbabylonische Rechtspraxis</i>,
published in <i>Wiener Zeitschrift f&uuml;r die Kunde des Morgenlandes</i>, vol. xxiv,
pp. 431-61, and again in the <i>Revue S&eacute;mitique</i>, 1912, pp. 378-97, <i>Zur
Frage der semitischen und sumerischen Elemente im altbabylonischen Rechte</i>.
See also <i>Das Sumerische in den Rechtsurkunden der Hammurabi-Periode</i>, by
<span class="smcap">M. Schorr</span>, in the <i>Hilprecht Anniversary Volume</i>, pp. 20-32.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>The question whether the Sumerian phrases in the contemporary
contracts were read as Semitic or Sumerian has been discussed by
<span class="smcap">A. Poebel</span> in the <i>Orientalistische Litteraturzeitung</i>, 1911, cols. 241-7,
under the title <i>Zur Aussprache der sumerischen Phrasen in den altbabylonischen
Rechtsurkunden</i>, and in cols. 373-4 <span class="smcap">A. Ungnad</span> wrote, under the same
title, <i>Eine Berichtigung</i>. <span class="smcap">M. Schorr</span> replied, cols. 559-61.</p>

<p>The question how far the Hammurabi Code was operative was soon
raised. The existence of a very large number of legal documents relating
to all manner of transactions seemed likely to afford a ready answer. In
1905 <span class="smcap">Br. Meissner</span> wrote his <i>Theorie und Praxis im altbabylonischen Recht</i>
for the <i>Mitteilungen der Vorderasiatischen Gesellschaft</i>, pp. 257-303. The
need of a more extended examination made the promise of <span class="smcap">Kohler</span> and
<span class="smcap">Peiser&#8217;s</span> <i>Hammurabi-Gesetz</i> so welcome, see p. <a href="#Page_67">67</a>. <span class="smcap">Kohler</span> and <span class="smcap">Ungnad</span>
have now fulfilled this by publishing in Heft III-V the whole available
material as <i>&Uuml;bersetzte Urkunden</i> with most valuable <i>Erl&auml;uterungen</i> (Leipzig,
Hinrichs, 1909-1911). A similar enterprise was undertaken by <span class="smcap">M. Schorr</span>
in <i>Kodeks Hammurabiego a owezesna praktyka prawna, Das Gesetzbuch
Hammurabis und die zeitgen&ouml;ssische Rechtspraxis</i>, in the <i>Bulletin de l&#8217;Acad&eacute;mie
des Sciences de Cracovie</i>, followed by <i>Altbabylonische Rechtsurkunden aus der
Zeit der I. babylonischen Dynastie</i> in the <i>Sitzungsberichte der kaiserlichen
Akademie der Wissenschaften in Wien, philosophisch-historische Klasse</i>, 155.
Band, 2. Abhandlung, 1907, 160. Band, 5. Abhandlung, 1909, and 165. Band, 2.
Abhandlung, 1910 (Vienna, A. H&ouml;lder), with transcription, translation,
and commentary. Together with <span class="smcap">Ungnad&#8217;s</span> work this should enable any
scholar to form a well-founded and independent judgement.</p>

<p>It is natural to inquire what were the laws of that earlier people in
Babylonia who preceded the Semites and are now called Sumerians.
The Semites took over their legal phrases, see above, and probably with
them some of their laws. The Semitic scribes drew up long lists of these
Sumerian phrases, many of which they still used in drawing up their legal
documents, just as Latin phrases or Norman-French lingered on in our
law-books. These phrases they translated, in parallel columns with the
Sumerian. Such books of phrases were issued in long series. One such
series, usually called <i>Ana Ittishu</i>, was discussed by <span class="smcap">Br. Meissner</span> in the
<i>Wiener Zeitschrift f&uuml;r die Kunde des Morgenlandes</i>, iv, pp. 301 ff. A great
deal of it is published by <span class="smcap">P. Haupt</span> in vol. i of the <i>Assyriologische
Bibliothek</i>; by <span class="smcap">F. Hommel</span> in his <i>Sumerische Lesest&uuml;cke</i>; by <span class="smcap">Fr. Delitzsch</span>
in his <i>Assyrische Lesest&uuml;cke</i>, 3rd edition, 1900, pp. 130-2; and by
<span class="smcap">Meissner</span> in the <i>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Assyriologie</i>, 1892, vii, pp. 16-32. <span class="smcap">Pinches</span>
gives an account of it in the <i>Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics</i>, iv,
p. 256, 1910, where he calls it the <i>Ulutinabishu Series</i>. Not much law
can be made out of this scrappy source; but one tablet records a set of
regulations which seem to be extracted from a code. They are usually
referred to as <i>The Sumerian Family Laws</i>,and are dealt with by
<span class="smcap">T. G. Pinches</span> in the <i>Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics</i>, iv, p. 257, 1910,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
and by <span class="smcap">Jeremias</span> in the same work, v, p. 447. A full treatment by
<span class="smcap">P. Haupt</span> is <i>Die sumerischen Familiengesetze in Keilschrift, Transcription
und &Uuml;bersetzung</i> (Leipzig, 1879). <span class="smcap">Winckler</span>, <span class="smcap">Cook</span>, <span class="smcap">Peiser</span>, <span class="smcap">Ungnad</span>, and
most of the writers on the comparative side have quoted them in their
above-named works.</p>

<p>It may be doubted whether the so-called <i>Warnings to Kings against
Injustice</i>, see <span class="smcap">T. G. Pinches</span> in his <i>Encyclopaedia</i> article, iv, p. 261, note 1,
are so early, or really preserve part of a code. References to legal
reforms may be seen in the inscriptions of Urukagina, see <span class="smcap">L. W. King&#8217;s</span>
<i>History of Sumer and Akkad</i>, pp. 178-84 and the references, but here
again we cannot reconstruct much of the Sumerian law in question.</p>

<p>We have noted the discussion, p. 75, of the way in which Semitic
scribes regarded the Sumerian phrases they used.</p>

<p>The conclusion that Hammurabi codified the earlier legislation was
natural, and similarities in form suggested that he adopted much of the
Sumerian law which was previously in force.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. T. Clay</span> in the <i>Orientalistische Litteraturzeitung</i>, xvii, January, 1914
(Leipzig, Hinrichs), writing on <i>A Sumerian Prototype of the Hammurabi
Code</i>, has made it clear that some of the laws existed in a Sumerian dress.
Hammurabi, as we have already contended, modified the previously
existing Sumerian laws, and taking some over bodily, changed others to
suit the peculiar prejudices of his subjects and the circumstances of his
time. We may soon be able to judge whether <span class="smcap">Clay&#8217;s</span> <i>Sumerian Code</i>, as
we may call it, was really early, or only the dress in which Hammurabi&#8217;s
law appeared in his Sumerian provinces.</p>

<p>We may pass on to notice briefly the chief sources from which it is
possible to deduce much of the local customary law throughout the history
of Babylonia. It may formally be divided into Temple accounts and
contracts, but a detailed classification would demand much more space
than we can here afford.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Temple Accounts.</span></h3>

<p>At all times the great temples of Assyria and Babylonia kept extensive
accounts of even daily revenue and expenditure. These accounts were
most carefully preserved, being written with special care on well selected
clay, and have reached us as a rule in exceptionally fine condition. They
give us an immense mass of information, largely consisting of dry and
disconnected items, but helping to build up knowledge. The French
explorations made by <span class="smcap">De Sarzec</span> at Telloh resulted in the discovery of
an enormous number of documents, mostly accounts kept of the daily
expenses and revenues of the vast temples there, from the earliest times
down to the Dynasty of Ur. One huge find of some 30,000 tablets of
the latter period were stolen by Arabs, and have been sold in large
quantities to European and American Museums, or to private collectors.
Few of them are legal documents, or concerned with other than Temple
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
business, but their contents illustrate the state of society in the times
before the First Dynasty of Babylon. They are most important for
determining the extent to which the Code of Hammurabi was dependent
on, or influenced by, the Sumerian Law of earlier days.</p>

<p>Of those which reached Constantinople, the products of the season
of 1894 consisted entirely of tablets of the Dynasty of Ur, and were
classified by <span class="smcap">V. Scheil</span>. The tablets found in 1895 were catalogued by
<span class="smcap">Thureau-Dangin</span>, and are mostly of the Dynasty of Akkad. The finds
of 1900 are all of the Dynasty of Ur. These are all now catalogued and
largely published in the <i>Inventaire des Tablettes de Tello conserv&eacute;es au
Mus&eacute;e Ottoman</i> (Paris, E. Leroux, 1910), by <span class="smcap">Fr. Thureau-Dangin</span> and
<span class="smcap">H. de Genouillac</span>.</p>

<p>But by far the largest part of the finds came into the hands of dealers,
and so into the museums of Europe and America; and these were
published sooner. Thus in 1891 some were reproduced by photography
in <span class="smcap">De Sarzec&#8217;s</span> <i>D&eacute;couvertes en Chald&eacute;e</i> (Paris, E. Leroux), plate 41.
These tablets, preserved in the Louvre, were, however, properly presented
by the Sultan. A great many thus acquired were published by <span class="smcap">Thureau-Dangin</span>
as <i>Tablettes chald&eacute;ennes in&eacute;dites</i> in the <i>Revue d&#8217;Assyriologie</i>, iv,
pp. 69-86 (Paris, E. Leroux, 1897). In the same journal, v, pp. 67-102,
1902, he gave a <i>Notice sur la troisi&egrave;me collection de tablettes</i>, and in 1903
published a <i>Recueil de tablettes chald&eacute;ennes</i> (Paris, E. Leroux), which gave
improved editions of the above. Other articles appeared in the <i>Revue
d&#8217;Assyriologie</i>, iii, pp. 118-46 (1895), iv, pp. 13-27 (1897), and in <i>Comptes
rendus de l&#8217;Acad&eacute;mie des Inscriptions</i> for 1896, by the same writer,
pp. 355-61. These works not only made available large numbers of texts,
but also gave most important contributions to their understanding.</p>

<p>In 1896 <span class="smcap">H. V. Hilprecht</span> published three of the tablets in the
Imperial Ottoman Museum at Constantinople in his <i>Old Babylonian
Inscriptions</i>, part II, nos. 124-6 (Philadelphia, <i>Transactions of the American
Philosophical Society</i>).</p>

<p>In <i>Cuneiform Texts from Babylonian Tablets, etc., in the British Museum</i>,
vols. i, iii, v, vii, ix, x (London, British Museum), copied by <span class="smcap">L. W. King</span>,
1896-1900; <i>Ancient Babylonian Temple Records</i>, copied by <span class="smcap">W. R. Arnold</span>
(New York, Columbia University Press, 1896); <i>Old Babylonian Temple
Records</i>, are texts copied and discussed by <span class="smcap">R. J. Lau</span> (New York, Columbia
University Press, 1906); <i>Haverford Library Collection of Cuneiform Tablets
or Documents from the Temple Archives of Telloh</i>, part I, 1905; part II,
1909; part III, 1914 (Philadelphia, J. C. Winston Co.), several hundreds
of these texts appeared.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">G. Reisner</span>, in 1902, published <i>Tempelurkunden aus Telloh</i> (Berlin,
W. Spemann), being the collection presented to the Berlin Museum by
<span class="smcap">H. Simon</span>. <span class="smcap">H. Radau</span> in his <i>Early Babylonian History</i> (New York, 1903),
published and discussed a number purchased for the E. A. Hoffmann collections
in the New York Metropolitan Museum. <span class="smcap">T. G. Pinches</span> dealt with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
<i>Some Case Tablets from Telloh</i> in the <i>Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society</i>
for 1905, pp. 815-29, and, in 1909, published <i>The Amherst Tablets</i>, being
an <i>Account of the Babylonian Inscriptions in the Collection of the Right
Honourable Lord Amherst of Hackney, at Didlington Hall, Norfolk</i> (London,
Quaritch). <span class="smcap">H. de Genouillac</span> published and discussed some texts of
<span class="smcap">H. Schlumberger&#8217;s</span> as <i>Tablettes d&#8217;Ur</i> in the <i>Hilprecht Anniversary
Volume</i>, pp. 137-41. In 1911 <span class="smcap">T. G. Pinches</span> dealt with some <i>Tablets
from Telloh in Private Collections</i> in <i>The Journal of the Royal Asiatic
Society</i>, pp. 1039-62, and <span class="smcap">St. Langdon</span> gave <i>Some Sumerian Contracts</i> in
the <i>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Assyriologie</i>, 1911, pp. 205-14. <span class="smcap">V. Scheil</span> contributed
a series of <i>Notes d&#8217;&eacute;pigraphie et d&#8217;arch&eacute;ologie assyriennes</i> to the <i>Recueil de
Travaux</i> (Paris, E. Bouillon), vol. xvii, 1895, pp. 28-30; xviii (1896),
pp. 64-74; xix (1897), pp. 44-64; xx (1898), pp. 55-72, 200-10; xxi
(1899), pp. 26-9, 123-6; xxii (1900), pp. 27-39, 78-80, 149-61; xxiii
(1901), pp. 18-23; xxiv (1902), pp. 24-9, in which among other priceless
records he gave many extracts from the Telloh texts, some entire texts,
and much elucidation of the same. Special studies devoted to the
subject are: <span class="smcap">H. de Genouillac&#8217;s</span> <i>Textes juridiques de l&#8217;&eacute;poque d&#8217;Ur</i> in the

pp. 81-132, by <span class="smcap">F. Pel&eacute;gaud</span>, and <i>Di-tilla, textes juridiques chald&eacute;ens de la
seconde dynastie d&#8217;Our</i>, by <span class="smcap">C. H. Virolleaud</span> (Poitiers, A. Boutifard, 1903);
<i>Comptabilit&eacute; chald&eacute;enne</i>, by the same author, same place and publisher,
1903, is a series of valuable essays. <span class="smcap">G. A. Barton</span> gave <i>A Babylonian
Ledger Account of Reeds and Wood</i> in the <i>American Journal of Semitic
Languages and Literatures</i>, 1911, pp. 322-7, and in the same journal,
1912, pp. 207-10, another text of the same sort.</p>

<p>Tablets of the same period have been found by the thousand at Jokha,
the ancient Umma, for centuries the hereditary foe of Telloh, and at
Dréhem, which seems to have been a closely dependent city of the
Nippur district. They have already found their way in large numbers
to Europe and America.</p>

<p>Tablets from Jokha were first noticed by <span class="smcap">V. Scheil</span> in his <i>Notes
d&#8217;&eacute;pigraphie et d&#8217;arch&eacute;ologie assyrienne</i> in <i>Recueil de Travaux</i>, vol. xix,
pp. 62-3, 1897, who showed that Jokha was Umma. <span class="smcap">Fr. Thureau-Dangin</span>
in the <i>Revue d&#8217;Assyriologie</i> (viii), 1911, pp. 152-8, who deals with
<i>Les noms des mois sur les tablettes de Djokha</i>, gives a number of these texts
from the time of the Dynasties of Akkad and Ur. <span class="smcap">St. Langdon</span> has
published <i>A tablet from Umma in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford</i> in the
<i>Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology</i>, 1913, pp. 47-52. In
contents these are very similar to the tablets from Telloh or Dréhem,
and seem to have been often confused with them by the dealers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Langdon</span> published <i>Tablets from the Archives of Dréhem</i> (Paris,
Geuthner, 1912); <span class="smcap">L. Delaporte</span>, <i>Tablettes de Dr&eacute;hem in Revue d&#8217;Assyriologie</i>

is <i>Some Published Texts from Dr&eacute;hem</i>, by <span class="smcap">I. M. Price</span>, in the <i>American

<p><i>Sumerian Administrative Documents from the Second Dynasty of Ur</i>, from
the <i>Temple Archives of Nippur</i>, vol. iii, part i of Series A, Cuneiform Texts,
in <i>Publications of the Babylonian Expedition of the University of Pennsylvania</i>
(Philadelphia, 1910), deals with closely related texts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. Huber</span> wrote <i>Die altbabylonischen Darlehenstexte aus der Nippur-Sammlung
im K. O. Museum in Konstantinopel</i> as a contribution to the
<i>Hilprecht Anniversary Volume</i>, pp. 189-222. <span class="smcap">V. Scheil</span> in his <i>Notes
d&#8217;&eacute;pigraphie</i> made some entries about those Nippur texts which reached
Constantinople, see p. <a href="#Page_78">78</a>.</p>

<p>An allied text was given by <span class="smcap">P. Dhorme</span> in the <i>Journal Asiatique</i>, 1912,
pp. 158-9, as <i>Un brouillon d&#8217;inventaire</i>.</p>

<p>The whole subject of these Temple Records is being studied by
<span class="smcap">H. Torczyner</span>, who has started with <i>Vorl&auml;ufige Bemerkungen</i> to <i>Altbabylonische
Tempelrechnungen, umschrieben und erkl&auml;rt</i> in the <i>Anzeiger der
Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften in Wien</i>, 1910, pp. 136-40.</p>

<p>On the general scope and purpose of the Temple Records, see the
article on <i>Babylonian Book-keeping</i>, by <span class="smcap">A. T. Clay</span>, in the <i>American Journal
of Archaeology</i>, 1910, pp. 74 ff.</p>

<p>The very ancient texts from Telloh, usually called Pre-Sargonic, have
been issued, beside <span class="smcap">Thureau-Dangin&#8217;s</span> <i>Recueil de Tablettes chald&eacute;ennes</i>,
by <span class="smcap">Allotte de la Fu&yuml;e</span> as <i>Documents pr&eacute;sargoniques</i> (Paris, E. Leroux,
1908, 1909). <i>Sumerian Tablets in the Harvard Semitic Museum</i> was begun,
by <span class="smcap">Mary Ida Hussey</span>, with part 1 in 1912. <i>Two Tablets of the Period of
Lugalanda</i> were published by <span class="smcap">St. Langdon</span> in <i>Babyloniaca</i>, 1911, pp. 246-7.
Much the most useful publication, however, is <i>Tablettes sum&eacute;riennes
archa&iuml;ques</i>, by <span class="smcap">H. de Genouillac</span> (Paris, Geuthner, 1909), which gives not
only texts, but transcriptions and such translation as is possible, and also
an admirable account of all they imply, as to law and custom. A considerable
amount of this is strikingly like the later laws. In <i>The Amherst
Tablets</i> (London, Quaritch, 1908), <span class="smcap">T. G. Pinches</span> published a few more.
The bulk of them still await publication.</p>

<p><i>Ancient Bullae and Seals of Shirpurla</i> by <span class="smcap">N. P. Likhatscheff</span>, published
in the <i>Imperial Russian Archaeological Society&#8217;s Classical Section IV</i>,
pp. 225-63, 1907, written in Russian, gives a number of similar tablets.
<i>Oriental Antiquities</i>, by <span class="smcap">M. V. Nikolsky</span>, in the <i>Oriental Commission of
the Imperial Moscow Archaeological Society</i>, iii, Series 2, 1908, has over
300 such texts. These appear to belong to the same period.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>Some valuable discussions will be found in <i>&Eacute;tat des d&eacute;c&egrave;s survenus dans
le personnel de la d&eacute;esse Bau sous le r&egrave;gne d&#8217;Urukagina</i>, by <span class="smcap">Allotte de la
Fu&yuml;e</span>, in the <i>Revue d&#8217;Assyriologie</i>, 1910, pp. 139-46.</p>

<p>In his <i>Recueil de Tablettes chald&eacute;ennes</i> (Paris, E. Leroux, 1903)
<span class="smcap">Fr. Thureau-Dangin</span> gave as his third series a number of texts of the
Sargonic period, dated in the reigns of Shargani-shar-ali and Naram-Sin.
A number more are published or described in the <i>Inventaire des tablettes
de Tello conserv&eacute;es au Mus&eacute;e Imp&eacute;rial Ottoman</i>, Tome I, by <span class="smcap">Thureau-Dangin</span>,
1910, and Tome II, by <span class="smcap">H. de Genouillac</span>, 1911, and several other
collections are to be published shortly.</p>

<p>The very early texts from the ancient Shuruppak which have reached
the Louvre were published by <span class="smcap">Thureau-Dangin</span> in his <i>Recueil</i> named
above, and in the <i>Revue d&#8217;Assyriologie</i>, vi (1904), pp. 143-54, he wrote
<i>Contrats archa&iuml;ques provenant de Shuruppak</i>, with the intention of deciphering
and explaining them as far as possible.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Contract Literature.</span></h3>

<p>Many texts published in the above collections of Temple Accounts are
bonds, deeds of sale, even legal decisions, &amp;c., and really come under the
head of contracts. But even among the collections of contracts some
accounts have been published, and it is scarcely necessary here to quote
the same book under both heads.</p>

<p>Curiously enough the first contracts to attract attention were of an
early date. <span class="smcap">Loftus</span> found at Senkereh a number of most interesting
case-tablets, the principal document being invariably enclosed in a clay
envelope which, as was subsequently discovered, was inscribed with an
abstract or practical duplicate of the principal document. Many speculations
arose as to their purpose. Some regarded them as a substitute for
money, or cheques, banknotes in clay (so <span class="smcap">Layard</span> in 1853), and other
weird guesses. <span class="smcap">George Smith</span> first recognized their meaning and value
for history by publishing their dates, the names which the Babylonians
gave to the years, calling them after some prominent event.</p>

<p>Discovered in 1854, they were first published in 1882 by <span class="smcap">J. N. Strassmaier</span>.
Owing to some misapprehension, as given in <span class="smcap">Layard&#8217;s</span> <i>Nineveh
and Babylon</i>, p. 496, despite the clear statement on pp. 270-72 of <span class="smcap">Loftus</span>,
<i>Travels and Researches in Chaldea and Susiana</i>, they were called <i>Die altbabylonischen
Vertr&auml;ge aus Warka</i> in the <i>Beilage</i> to the <i>Verhandlungen des
V. internationalen Orientalistischen Congresses zu Berlin</i>, 1881. They were
accompanied by a list of words and names. <span class="smcap">E.</span> and <span class="smcap">V. Revillout</span> discussed
them most interestingly in <i>Une Famille de commer&ccedil;ants de Warka</i>.
They proved to be of the time of Hammurabi and his son Samsu-iluna
after these kings had expelled Rîm-Sin from the South of Babylonia.
But there were several dated in the reign of Rîm-Sin, and in those of
Sin-idinnam and N&ucirc;r-adad, kings who had preceded him. Thus they
showed how, despite changes of dynasty, the civil life of the subject
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
population went on undisturbed, and customs changed but little. They
show how closely the Code pictures the daily life of the people. As
most illustrative of the Code, constituting a contemporary commentary
on its regulations and consisting chiefly of examples of the same cases as
there considered, we may here group in order of publication the collections
from the First Dynasty of Babylon.</p>

<p><i>Inscribed Babylonian Tablets in the possession of Sir Henry Peek, Bart.</i>,
1888, contained a few texts of this period, copied, transcribed, and
translated by <span class="smcap">T. G. Pinches</span>. This made considerable advances, but
there was not yet enough material to solve many obscurities. These
tablets came from Sippara.</p>

<p>It was evident that the only hope of understanding such technical
documents lay in the publication of further material, so that by comparison
of similar passages some information could be obtained as to
alternative readings and phrases.</p>

<p>In 1893 a great advance was made by <span class="smcap">Meissner</span> with his <i>Beitr&auml;ge zum
altbabylonischen Privatrecht</i> (Leipzig, Hinrichs), which gave a full transliteration
and translation of 111 texts, all carefully published in autography.
Full notes and invaluable comments made this a standard work.
The texts were chiefly from tablets found at Sippara, and stored in the
British Museum, and at Berlin where a large quantity had been purchased.
<span class="smcap">Meissner</span> also reproduced some of the Warka texts.</p>

<p>In the fourth volume of <span class="smcap">Schrader&#8217;s</span> <i>Keilinschriftliche Bibliothek</i>, 1896,
<span class="smcap">F. E. Peiser</span> gave a collection of contract texts in transcription and
translation, arranged in chronological order. He included thirty-one
texts of this period (Berlin, Reuther and Reichard). These were called
<i>Texte juristischen und gesch&auml;ftlichen Inhalts</i>, and marked a further advance
in treatment. In this year also began the great series of publications
called <i>Cuneiform Texts from Babylonian Tablets, &amp;c., in the British Museum,
printed by order of the Trustees</i>. Vols. ii, iv, vi, and viii (1896, 1897, 1898,
1899), contain copies of no fewer than 395 texts mostly of this period,
a most valuable addition to our knowledge of the subject. They were
from the practised hand of <span class="smcap">T. G. Pinches</span>, who gave in the <i>Journal of the
Royal Asiatic Society</i>, 1897 and 1899, some transliterations and translations
with notes and comments on fifteen of them. They were all Sippara
tablets.</p>

<p>In 1902 appeared <i>Une saison de fouilles &agrave; Sippar</i> (Le Caire, Institut
Fran&ccedil;ais), in which <span class="smcap">V. Scheil</span> gave an account of his explorations at
Abu Habba, the ancient Sippara, in 1892-1893, and many texts in
a preliminary form, with transcription, translation, and comments, thus
making known a most valuable supplement to the earlier publications of
First Dynasty tablets.</p>

<p>In 1906 <span class="smcap">Th. Friedrich</span> published in the <i>Beitr&auml;ge zur Assyriologie</i>,
vol. v, a number of texts from the tablets found by <span class="smcap">Scheil</span> at Sippara,
and then preserved in the Museum at Constantinople, as <i>Altbabylonische</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
<i>Urkunden aus Sippara</i> (Leipzig, Hinrichs), which completed <span class="smcap">Scheil&#8217;s</span> work
in many ways.</p>

<p>In 1906, <span class="smcap">A. H. Ranke</span> published <i>Babylonian Legal and Business Documents
from the time of the First Babylonian Dynasty</i>, as vol. vi, part 1, of the
Series A, Cuneiform Texts, of the <i>Publications of the Babylonian Expedition
of the University of Pennsylvania</i> (Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania).
They probably all came from Sippara, though two may be from Babylon,
unless the king was then holding Court in Sippara.</p>

<p>In 1908 <span class="smcap">J. &Eacute;. Gautier</span> gave us <i>Archives d&#8217;une famille de Dilbat au
temps de la Premi&egrave;re Dynastie de Babylon</i> (Le Caire, Institut Fran&ccedil;ais),
with transcriptions and translations of sixty-six tablets from a new site,
which the contents of the texts certainly prove to be that of the ancient
city of Dilbat. The work was well done, but needed revision by fresh
material.</p>

<p>About this time native diggers brought to light fresh material from
several new sites. Especially valuable were the texts from Kish, Larsa,
Opis, Babylon, and Shittab. These were eagerly acquired by the various
Museums, and shortly gave rise to a crop of fresh publications.</p>

<p>In 1909 came <i>Babylonian Legal and Business Documents from the time of
the First Dynasty of Babylon</i>, by <span class="smcap">A. Poebel</span>, being vol. vi, part 2, of Series A,
Cuneiform Texts, of the <i>Publications of the Babylonian Expedition of the
University of Pennsylvania</i> (Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania).
Again a fresh site, the ancient Nippur, yielded its contribution. Here
most of the tablets exhibit the old Sumerian phraseology.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. Ungnad</span> published, in 1909, a large number of texts from tablets in
the Berlin Museum, acquired at various dates. They appeared as vols.
vii, viii, ix of the <i>Vorderasiatische Denkm&auml;ler</i> (Leipzig, Hinrichs). Most
of them undoubtedly came from Sippara; one from Der-ez-Zor, near the
Chabour, and those in vol. vii from Dilbat, apparently the modern Delam.
Thus we can again compare contemporary documents from a fresh site,
which proves to have been influenced by other peoples, the Mitanni,
Elamites, &amp;c. In <i>Urkunden aus Dilbat</i>, vol. vi, part 5, of the <i>Beitr&auml;ge zur
Assyriologie</i> (Leipzig, Hinrichs, 1909), <span class="smcap">A. Ungnad</span> transcribes, translates,
and comments upon the large collection of letters and contracts which
had been published from Dilbat. His works brought a large amount of
most valuable information for the period.</p>

<p>In 1910 <span class="smcap">Thureau-Dangin</span> issued <i>Lettres et contrats de l&#8217;&eacute;poque de la
Premi&egrave;re dynastie babylonienne</i> (Paris, Geuthner), a most valuable work for
its indexes, as well as the interesting texts. A long and extremely fine
text was also given by him as <i>Un jugement sous Ammiditana</i>, in <i>Revue
d&#8217;Assyriologie</i>, 1910, pp. 121-7. Here were texts from Sippara, Babylon,
Dilbat, Kish, and possibly Shittab, as well as some more from Der-ez-Zor.
In the <i>Revue d&#8217;Assyriologie</i>, 1911, pp. 68-79, <span class="smcap">Thureau-Dangin</span> published
<i>Sept contrats</i> of the reigns of the kings of Kish, who were contemporary
with the foundation of the First Dynasty and themselves Amorites.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">St. Langdon</span> published several more of these <i>Tablets from Kish</i> in the
<i>Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology</i>, 1911, pp. 185-96, and
in the same journal for 1912, pp. 109-13, gave eleven <i>Contracts from
Larsa</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. E. Keiser</span> published <i>Tags and Labels from Nippur</i> in <i>The Museum
Journal of Philadelphia</i>, vol. iii, no. 2, pp. 29-31. These closely related
documents form a borderland between contracts and accounts.</p>

<p>These contracts are so much more important for the elucidation of the
Code than any later documents that we may now notice the chief
discussions of them.</p>

<p>Not much of this class of documents has yet come to light for the
Third or Kassite Dynasty of Babylon. <span class="smcap">A. T. Clay</span> gave us vols. xiv,
xv of the <i>Publications of the Babylonian Expedition of the University of
Pennsylvania</i> (Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, 1906), entitled
<i>Documents from the Temple Archives of Nippur, dated in the Reigns of Cassite
Rulers</i>. They showed how the old customs were preserved and modified
with fresh immigrations. These were followed in 1912 by <i>Documents
from the Temple Archives of Nippur, dated in the Reigns of Cassite Rulers, the
Museum Publications of the Babylonian Section</i>, vol. ii, no. 2 (Philadelphia
Museum), completing the collections. Some of the same sort from
Nippur, in the <span class="smcap">E. A. Hoffmann</span> collection in the Metropolitan Museum
in New York, were noted in <span class="smcap">Radau&#8217;s</span> <i>Early Babylonian History</i>, pp. 328-9
(New York, 1900).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F. E. Peiser</span>, in 1905, had published <i>Urkunden aus der Zeit der dritten
babylonischen Dynastie in Urschrift, Umschrift und &Uuml;bersetzung, dazu Rechtsausf&uuml;hrungen
von J. Kohler</i> (Berlin, Wolf Peiser). These appear to have
belonged to a family of Babylonians, some of whom adopted Cassite
names. More of the same group found their way to the Berlin Museums,
and more are in private hands and in the Louvre.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. J. Ball</span> contributed to the <i>Proceedings of the Society of Biblical
Archaeology</i> for 1907, pp. 273-4, <i>A Kassite Text</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D. D. Luckenbill</span> in the <i>American Journal of Semitic Languages and
Literatures</i>, 1907, pp. 280-322, gave a most valuable <i>Study of the Temple
Documents from the Cassite Period</i>.</p>

<p>The scarcity of legal documents from this period may be estimated
from the fact that in <i>Texte juristischen und gesch&auml;ftlichen Inhalts</i> (see p. <a href="#Page_81">81</a>,
above) only the so-called boundary-stones could be quoted.</p>

<p>It is in the Third Dynasty of Babylon that the Boundary-Stone or
Kudurru inscriptions first appear. These have been much discussed,
especially from the side of the curious symbols which occur upon them,
often regarded as signs of the Zodiac, or emblems of the gods.</p>

<p>In the <i>Beitr&auml;ge zur Assyriologie</i>, vol. ii, pp. 111-204, a number of such
texts were published and partly discussed by <span class="smcap">C. Belser</span>, as <i>Babylonische
Kudurru-Inschriften</i>. <span class="smcap">Peiser</span> incorporated some in the fourth volume of
<span class="smcap">Schrader&#8217;s</span> <i>Keilinschriftliche Bibliothek</i>. <span class="smcap">W. J. Hinke</span> gave in 1907, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
vol. iv of Series D of the <i>Publications of the Babylonian Expedition of the
University of Pennsylvania</i> (Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania),
<i>A New Boundary-Stone of Nebuchadrezzar I from Nippur</i>, in which he also
gave a full bibliography of the subject, collected names, words, &amp;c., from
all the texts of the sort hitherto published, and discussed the symbols.
In <i>Babylonian Boundary-stones and Memorial Tablets in the British Museum,
with an Atlas of Plates</i> (London, British Museum, 1912), <span class="smcap">L. W. King</span> gave
the whole of the British Museum material. In 1911 <span class="smcap">Hinke</span> contributed
to the <i>Semitic Study Series</i> (Leiden, E. J. Brill), a useful collection in
<i>Selected Babylonian Kudurru Inscriptions</i>. Many such inscriptions are
published by <span class="smcap">V. Scheil</span> with transcriptions and translations in <i>M&eacute;moires
de la D&eacute;l&eacute;gation en Perse</i> (Paris, E. Leroux), vols. ii, pp. 86-94, 97-116;
vi, pp. 30-47; vii, 137-53; x, 87-96. <span class="smcap">F. Steinmetzer</span> contributed <i>Eine
Schenkungsurkunde des K&ouml;nigs Melishichu</i> to the <i>Beitr&auml;ge zur Assyriologie</i>,
vol. viii, pp. 1-38.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hinke</span> gives an excellent bibliography of the Babylonian <i>kudurru</i>
inscriptions, their publications, transliterations, translations, and discussions.
Some are of the nature of <i>Freibriefe</i>, and <span class="smcap">Meissner</span> so treated
one in the <i>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Assyriologie</i>, 1889, pp. 259-67, cf. pp. 403-4.
He also wrote <i>Assyrische Freibriefe</i> in the <i>Beitr&auml;ge zur Assyriologie</i> II.
(1894), pp. 565-72, 581-8, giving text, transliteration, translation, and
discussion of three examples from the reign of Ashurbanipal and one of
Adad-nirari. In my <i>Assyrian Deeds and Documents</i> (Cambridge, Deighton,
Bell &amp; Co., 1902), nos. 646, 647, 648, and 651, I republished these
texts and added nos. 649, 650, two texts of Ashur-etil-il&acirc;ni, son and
successor of Ashurbanipal, nos. 652, 653, 654, 655, 656 (= 808 in vol. ii) of
Adad-nirari, nos. 657, 658 (dated in <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> 730), 659 (names Tiglath-Pileser),
660 (now joined to other fragments as 809, an important grant by
Sargon II in connexion with the site of Dur-Sargon), 661, 662(?), 663,
and possibly also nos. 669, 671, 672, 673, 674 (see now no. 1101), 692
(now part of 807), 714 (now part of 809), and in vol. ii, nos. 734, 735,
736, 737, 738(?), 739, 740(?), 741(?), on to 752, all possible fragments
of similar proclamations, <i>Freibriefe</i>, charters, or the schedules to them.
I have collected the references here, as the texts seem to have met with
insufficient attention. <span class="smcap">Winckler</span> had published parts of some of them
in his <i>Altorientalische Forschungen</i> (Leipzig, E. Pfeiffer, 1898), vol. ii,
pp. 4-8, and assigned the Ashur-etil-il&acirc;ni texts to Esarhaddon&#8217;s reign,
and in the note on p. 192 to Sin-shar-ishkun. <span class="smcap">F. E. Peiser</span> made some
acute suggestions as to the readings of the text and their meanings.</p>

<p>On no. 809 <span class="smcap">Meissner</span> wrote a full discussion in the <i>Mitteilungen der
Vorderasiatischen Gesellschaft</i>, 1903, pp. 85-96.</p>

<p>In 1883 <span class="smcap">H. V. Hilprecht</span> published <i>Freibrief Nebukadnezar&#8217;s I.</i> (Leipzig,
Hinrichs), with great advances on the previous treatment, and published
others in <i>Old Babylonian Inscriptions</i>, vol. i, part 1 (1893), nos. 80, 83,
part 2 (1896), nos. 149, 150. In 1891 <span class="smcap">K. L. Tallqvist</span> wrote on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
<i>Babylonische Schenkungsbriefe</i> (Helsingfors). In the <i>Beitr&auml;ge zur Assyriologie</i>,
1894, pp. 258-73, <span class="smcap">Fr. Delitzsch</span> published and admirably treated
<i>Der Berliner Merodachbaladan-Stein</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ed. Cuq</span> in <i>La Propri&eacute;t&eacute; fonci&egrave;re en Chald&eacute;e</i> gave a new view of the
meaning of these documents and the significance of their first appearing
in the Kassite period. It will be seen from the titles given in the
above works that no complete unanimity prevails as to their nature and
purpose.</p>

<p>We may now turn back to the class of texts usually called contracts.</p>

<p>The Assyrian empire has not yielded much of this class of document,
before the time of Sargon II, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 785-722. A number of texts have
been reported in the <i>Mitteilungen der Deutschen Orient-Gesellschaft zu
Berlin</i> as found at Asshur by the German excavators there, which date
from times both early and late. The publication of these texts will
doubtless soon be achieved and add greatly to our knowledge. The
treatment in Assyria seems to be largely reminiscent of that of Babylonia
under the First Dynasty, but there are wide divergences doubtless due
to the foreign elements in the Assyrian population. We are not yet
possessed of sufficient material to assign the changes to their true causes,
but we know enough to be sure that they were not on the whole due to
contemporary developments in Babylonia.</p>

<p>In <i>Assyrian Deeds and Documents relating to the transfer of Property</i>, in
three volumes, by <span class="smcap">C. H. W. Johns</span>, published in 1898-1901 (Deighton,
Bell &amp; Co., Cambridge, 3 vols.), practically all the material of this class in
the British Museum then catalogued was edited. These tablets apparently
all came from Nineveh. There are now many more similar tablets in the
British Museum listed in the <i>Supplement to the Catalogue</i>. Recently in
<i>Assyrische Rechtsurkunden von J. Kohler und A. Ungnad</i> (Leipzig, Ed. Pfeiffer,
1913), a series of transliterations and translations have been commenced
which will form a key to the whole, including many other texts since
published.</p>

<p>It was on these texts that <span class="smcap">J. Oppert</span> formed his views given in <i>Das
Assyrische Landrecht</i>, and in <i>Le droit de retrait lignager &agrave; Ninive</i>, see p. <a href="#Page_72">72</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. Scheil</span> published in his <i>Notes d&#8217;&eacute;pigraphie</i> in the <i>Recueil de Travaux</i>,
xx, note xl (1898), pp. 202-5, four tablets which possibly did not come
from Nineveh. I republished the texts as nos. 779-82 in my <i>Deeds and
Documents</i> above. The first is discussed by <span class="smcap">Meissner</span> as <i>Eine assyrische
Schenkungsurkunde</i> in the <i>Mitteilungen der Vorderasiatischen Gesellschaft</i>,
1903, pp. 103-5, where he points out that my no. 619 is another like
text. Here Adi-mati-ilu and other property were given to a son who
was to take a double portion and divide the rest with his brothers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F. E. Peiser</span> in the <i>Orientalistische Litteraturzeitung</i>, 1905, cols. 130-4,
gave <i>Ein neuer assyrischer Kontrakt</i>, <span class="smcap">V. Scheil</span> in the same journal for
1904, col. 70, and in the <i>Recueil de Travaux</i>, xxiv, note lxii, p. 24,
pointed out others, while in <i>Vorderasiatische Schriftdenkm&auml;ler</i>, vol. i,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
nos. 84-111, <span class="smcap">A. Ungnad</span> published several more from Kannu&#8217; and Kerk&ucirc;k.
<span class="smcap">S. Schiffer</span> discussed many of these as <i>Keilschriftliche Spuren der in der
zweiten H&auml;lfte des 8</i>. <i>Jahrhunderts von den Assyrern nach Mesopotamien
deportierten Samarier, a Beiheft to Orientalistische Litteraturzeitung</i> (Berlin,
W. Peiser, 1907), with which may be compared an article in the
<i>Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology</i>, 1908, pp. 107-15, 137-41,
on <i>The Lost Ten Tribes of Israel</i>, by <span class="smcap">C. H. W. Johns</span>. In an article <i>Aus
dem Louvre</i>, <span class="smcap">F. E. Peiser</span> published in the <i>Orientalistische Litteraturzeitung</i>,
1903, cols. 192-200, a new collation of no. 1,141 in my <i>Deeds
and Documents</i>, which had been formerly treated by <span class="smcap">Place</span>, <span class="smcap">Oppert</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Strassmaier</span>; and an edition of another text of this class. The new
<i>Supplement to the Catalogue of the Tablets in the Kouyunjik Collection in the
British Museum</i>, by <span class="smcap">L. W. King</span> (London, British Museum, 1914), shows
that many more such texts await publication, and there are others in the
Museums in England and America.</p>

<p>This class of document was early known for the times of the Neo-babylonian
Empire, and thousands of the so-called contracts have been
published down to the century before the Christian era.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J. Oppert</span> began the task of publishing and deciphering contracts, for
which his legal training as well as his philological learning especially
fitted him. His work may be gathered from the bibliography in the
second volume of the <i>Beitr&auml;ge zur Assyriologie</i>, pp. 523-56. His great
effort was <i>Documents juridiques de l&#8217;Assyrie et de la Chald&eacute;e</i> (Paris,
Maisonneuve, 1877), but he continued to deal with contracts up to his
death. Here as elsewhere comparison of fresh material continually
brought new light.</p>

<p>A number of such tablets were copied by <span class="smcap">T. G. Pinches</span>(?) for the
fifth volume of <i>Inscriptions of Western Asia</i> (London, British Museum,
1909, plates lxvii, lxviii), on which <span class="smcap">Oppert</span> built his determination
of Babylonian measures. <span class="smcap">J. N. Strassmaier</span>, in 1855, published <i>Die
babylonischen Inschriften im Museum zu Liverpool nebst anderen aus der Zeit
von Nebukadnezar bis Darius</i> (Leiden, J. Brill).</p>

<p>The tablets in the British Museum from Sippara, Babylon, Borsippa,
&amp;c., dated in the reigns of Nebuchadrezzar, Nabopolassar, Evil-Merodach,
Neriglissar, Nabonidus, Cyrus, Cambyses, and Darius, were also edited by
<span class="smcap">J. N. Strassmaier</span> as <i>Babylonische Texte, Inschriften von den Thontafeln
des British Museums copiert und autographiert</i>, in twelve volumes (Leipzig,
1887-1897). On the mass of material thus rendered available to scholars
were based a very large number of memoirs and monographs which may
be arranged here. <span class="smcap">K. L. Tallqvist</span>, in 1890, published <i>Die Sprache der
Contracte Nab&ucirc;-n&acirc;&#8217;id&#8217;s</i> (Helsingfors, J. C. Frenckell), in which he
collected all the words and phrases occurring in these texts, with useful
indexes. <span class="smcap">R. Zehnpfund</span> gave <i>Babylonische Weberrechnungen</i> in the <i>Beitr&auml;ge
zur Assyriologie</i>, i, pp. 492ff. (1890): <span class="smcap">L. Demuth</span>, <i>F&uuml;nfzig Rechts-und
Verwaltungsurkunden aus der Zeit des K&ouml;nigs Kyros</i>, in the same journal,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
vol. iii, pp. 393-444 (1898); <span class="smcap">E. Ziemer</span>, <i>F&uuml;nfzig Rechts-und Verwaltungsurkunden
aus der Zeit des K&ouml;nigs Kambyses</i>, same volume, pp. 445-92;
<span class="smcap">V. Marx</span>, <i>Die Stellung der Frauen in Babylonien gem&auml;ss den Kontrakten aus
der Zeit von Nebukadnezar bis Darius</i>, same journal, vol. iv, pp. 1-77,
1902; and <span class="smcap">E. Kotalla</span>, <i>F&uuml;nfzig babylonische Rechts-und Verwaltungsurkunden
aus der Zeit des K&ouml;nigs Artaxerxes I</i>, same volume, pp. 551-74.
<span class="smcap">Fr. Delitzsch</span> contributed <i>Notizen zu den neubabylonischen Kontrakttafeln</i>,
same journal, vol. iii, pp. 385-92 (1898), and <span class="smcap">J. Kohler</span>, <i>Ein Beitrag zum
neubabylonischen Recht</i>, vol. iv, pp. 423-30. <span class="smcap">F. E. Peiser</span>, in 1889,
published <i>Keilinschriftliche Actenst&uuml;cke aus babylonischen St&auml;dten</i> (Berlin,
W. Peiser), and, in 1890, <i>Babylonische Vertr&auml;ge des Berliner Museums</i>
(Berlin, W. Peiser). This marked great advances on <span class="smcap">Oppert&#8217;s</span> work,
owing to <span class="smcap">Strassmaier&#8217;s</span> new material and the Berlin collections. He
next contributed a selection of transliterations and translations to the
fourth volume of <span class="smcap">Schrader&#8217;s</span> <i>Keilinschriftliche Bibliothek</i> (1896), p. 81,
above. Then from 1890-1898 appeared <i>Aus dem babylonischen Rechtsleben</i>
(Leipzig, Pfeiffer), in conjunction with <span class="smcap">J. Kohler</span>, containing many new
texts. <span class="smcap">A. B. Moldenke</span>, in 1893, published for the Metropolitan Museum
at New York a volume of <i>Cuneiform Texts</i>, all of this period. In 1890
appeared <i>Recherches sur quelques contrats babyloniens</i>, by <span class="smcap">A. Boissier</span>
(Paris, E. Leroux).</p>

<p>In the <i>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Assyriologie</i> (Weimar, E. Felber, 1894) <span class="smcap">Y. le Gac</span>
published <i>Quelques inscriptions assyro-babyloniennes du Mus&eacute;e Lycklama
&agrave; Cannes</i>, pp. 385-90, and in <i>Babyloniaca</i> (Paris, P. Geuthner, 1910),
<i>Textes babyloniens de la Collection Lycklama &agrave; Cannes</i>, pp. 33-72. In
1902 <span class="smcap">T. G. Pinches</span> contributed to the <i>Verhandlungen des XIII</i>.
<i>Orientalistischen Congresses</i> some <i>Notes on a Small Collection of Tablets from
the Birs Nimroud belonging to Lord Amherst of Hackney</i>.</p>

<p>In vols. III-VI of the <i>Vorderasiatische Schriftdenkm&auml;ler</i> (1907-1908),
<span class="smcap">A. Ungnad</span> published many texts of this period, and gave later some
valuable <i>Untersuchungen</i> on the same, <i>Aus der altbabylonischen Kontrakt-literatur</i>,
to the <i>Orientalistische Litteraturzeitung</i>, 1912, cols. 106-8.</p>

<p>A new source for this material was the finds at Nippur, printed in
<i>The Publications of the Babylonian Expedition of the University of Pennsylvania</i>,
Philadelphia, Series A. <i>Cuneiform Texts</i>, vol. viii, part 1
contained <i>Legal and Commercial Transactions from the Neo-babylonian Empire
to Darius II</i>, by <span class="smcap">A. T. Clay</span>, 1908; vols. ix and x, by the same author,
contained <i>Business Documents of Murashû Sons of Nippur in the reign of
Artaxerxes I</i> (1898), and <i>Business Documents in the reign of Darius II</i>
(1904). A new series has since been commenced.</p>

<p><i>The Museum Publications of the Babylonian Section of the University of

<i>Study Series</i>, by <span class="smcap">A. Ungnad</span> (Leiden, Brill, 1908), forms a useful introduction
to the subject.</p>

<p>In 1911 appeared <i>Hundert ausgew&auml;hlte Rechtsurkunden aus der Sp&auml;tzeit
des babylonischen Schrifltums von Xerxes bis Mithridates, 485-93 v. Chr.</i>, by
<span class="smcap">A. Ungnad</span> and <span class="smcap">J. Kohler</span> (Leipzig, Pfeiffer), and <span class="smcap">I. L. Holt</span> contributed
to the <i>American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures</i> a study of
<i>some Tablets from the R. C. Thompson Collection in Haskell Oriental Museum,
The University of Chicago</i>.</p>

<p>Of considerable interest as in some senses a link between Babylonia
and Palestine are the Cappadocian Tablets. The first notice of them
was given by <span class="smcap">T. G. Pinches</span> in the <i>Proceedings of the Society of Biblical
Archaeology</i>, Nov. 1, 1881, pp. 11-18. Some tablets in the British
Museum were acquired from a dealer who said they had been found in
Cappadocia. The script was then quite unfamiliar, and they were
supposed at first to be written in a language neither Sumerian nor
Semitic. <span class="smcap">Golenischeff</span> published in 1891 the text of twenty-four
tablets of the same class which he had acquired at Kaisareyeh. He
made out that many words were Assyrian and read many names. <span class="smcap">Fr. Delitzsch</span>
made a most valuable study of them in the <i>Abhandlungen
der philos.-hist. Classe der K. S&auml;chs. Gesellschaft d. Wissenschaften</i>, 1893,
no. 11. In 1894 <span class="smcap">P. Jensen</span> in the <i>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Assyriologie</i>, vol. ix,
pp. 62-81, made many corrections and additions. <span class="smcap">F. E. Peiser</span> then
discussed them in his introduction to the fourth volume of <span class="smcap">Schrader</span>&#8217;s
<i>Keilinschriftliche Bibliothek</i>, and gave the transcription and translation of
the texts of nine, pp. 50-56. A considerable number more were discovered
at Boghaz Köi, Kara Eyuk, and elsewhere, and published by
<span class="smcap">V. Scheil</span> in the <i>M&eacute;moires de la Mission en Cappadoce</i>, and commented
upon by <span class="smcap">A. Boissier</span> in the <i>Proceedings of the Society for Biblical Archaeology</i>,
1900, pp. 106 ff. Four Cappadocian tablets were published by
<span class="smcap">Thureau-Dangin</span> among his <i>Lettres et Contrats</i>, see p. <a href="#Page_82">82</a>, above.</p>

<p>In <i>Babyloniaca</i>, 1908, pp. 1-45, <span class="smcap">A. H. Sayce</span> translated the Golenischeff
texts, and others published by Chantre, or found by Ramsay, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. G. Pinches</span> with <span class="smcap">A. H. Sayce</span> published and discussed <i>The Cappadocian
Tablet from Yuzghat in the Liverpool Institute of Archaeology</i>, 1906.</p>

<p>In 1908 <span class="smcap">T. G. Pinches</span> published twenty more in the <i>Annals of
Archaeology of the Liverpool University</i>, vol. i, pp. 49-80. In the <i>Florilegium
de Vog&uuml;&eacute;</i>, pp. 591-k, <span class="smcap">Thureau-Dangin</span> discussed <i>Un acte de
r&eacute;pudiation sur une tablette cappadocienne</i>, 1909, and in the <i>Revue d&#8217;Assyriologie</i>,
1911, pp. 142-51, gave more texts fixing <i>La date des tablettes
cappadociennes</i> as contemporary with the <i>Dynasty of Ur</i> in Babylonia,
thus proving cuneiform to have been widely used in that region to write
a Semitic language long before the time of Hammurabi. In <i>Babyloniaca</i>,
1911, pp. 65-80, <span class="smcap">A. H. Sayce</span> gave some <i>Cappadocian Cuneiform Tablets
from Kara Eyuk</i>, affiliating them with early Assyrian rulers. In the
same journal, 1911, pp. 216-28, <span class="smcap">A. Boissier</span> gave more texts under the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
title <i>Nouveaux documents de Boghaz K&ouml;i</i>. In the same journal, 1912,
pp. 182-93, <span class="smcap">A. H. Sayce</span> wrote upon <i>The Cappadocian Cuneiform Tablets
of the University of Pennsylvania</i>.</p>

<p>All these works have contributed comments of more or less value,
and the whole point to a close connexion with Babylonia and Assyria,
and the extended use of cuneiform in Cappadocia from very early times,
whence it was doubtless taken over by the later Hittites.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Babylonian and Assyrian Letters.</span></h3>

<p>A very large number of letters have been preserved to us from all
periods of Babylonian and Assyrian history. Many of them are addressed
to private correspondents, and concern matters of everyday life. They
are often most obscure, as they assume so much knowledge on the part of
the recipient which is withheld from us. Where we can grasp their
reference they furnish considerable light upon social conditions.</p>

<p>A large number, however, are royal letters or dispatches from the king
and his officers to subordinates, or <i>vice versa</i>. These more often concern
public affairs.</p>

<p>As yet few letters have come down to us which we can date before
the First Dynasty of Babylon, but some will be found in the <i>Inventaire
des tablettes de Tello</i> (see p. <a href="#Page_80">80</a>), and among the various publications of
Temple accounts and contracts, as early as the times of Sargon of Akkad.</p>

<p>In the <i>Beitr&auml;ge zur Assyriologie</i>, vol. ii, pp. 557-64, 572-9, <span class="smcap">Meissner</span>
published <i>Altbabylonische Briefe</i> (1893), with discussions.</p>

<p>In the times of Hammurabi, or the First Dynasty of Babylon, our
sources for epistolary correspondence become very ample. <span class="smcap">L. W. King</span>
in his magnificent work, <i>The Letters and Inscriptions of Hammurabi, King
of Babylon, about <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> 2200; to which is added a series of letters of other
Kings of the First Dynasty of Babylon</i> (vol. i, <i>Introduction and Babylonian
Texts</i>; vol. ii, <i>Babylonian Texts</i>, continued; vol. iii, <i>English Translation,
Commentary, Vocabularies, Introduction, etc.</i>, London, Luzac &amp; Co., 1898),
gave a complete edition of these letters. The materials for history and
social life were epoch-making. In the <i>Beitr&auml;ge zur Assyriologie</i> <span class="smcap">G. Nagel</span>
translated a number of these texts, <i>Briefe Hammurabi&#8217;s an Sin-iddinam</i>,
vol. iv, pp. 434-83, to which <span class="smcap">Fr. Delitzsch</span> added <i>Zusatzbemerkungen</i>,
pp. 483-500. He, with <span class="smcap">J. A. Knudtzon</span>, wrote on the same subject,
vol. iv, pp. 88-100. <span class="smcap">M. W. Montgomery</span> took <i>Briefe aus der Zeit des
babylonischen K&ouml;nigs Hammurabi</i> as subject for her doctor&#8217;s dissertation
(Leipzig, Pries, 1901). <span class="smcap">A. Klostermann</span> published <i>Ein diplomatischer
Briefwechsel aus dem 2. Jahrtausend v. Chr.</i> (Leipzig, Deichert, 1903).
<span class="smcap">C. V. Gelderen</span> contributed <i>Ausgew&auml;hlte babylonisch-assyrische Briefe</i> to the
<i>Beitr&auml;ge zur Assyriologie</i>, iv, 1902, pp. 501-45. Another great collection
was published by <span class="smcap">Thureau-Dangin</span> in <i>Lettres et contrats de l&#8217;&eacute;poque de la
premi&egrave;re dynastie babylonienne</i> (Paris, P. Geuthner, 1910). The author
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
transliterated, translated, and commented upon three of these texts as
<i>Lettres de l&#8217;&eacute;poque de la premi&egrave;re dynastie babylonienne</i> in <i>The Hilprecht
Anniversary Volume</i>, pp. 156-63.</p>

<p><i>Les Lettres de Hammurapi &agrave; Sin-idinnam, transcription, traduction et commentaire,
pr&eacute;c&eacute;d&eacute;es d&#8217;une &eacute;tude sur deux caract&egrave;res du style assyro-babylonien</i>,
by <span class="smcap">F. C. Jean</span> (Paris, J. Gabalda, 1913), gives an idea of the subject.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P. S. Landersdorfer</span>, in 1908, had edited <i>Altbabylonische Privatbriefe,
transkribiert, &uuml;bersetzt und kommentiert, nebst einer Einleitung und 4 Registern</i>
(Paderborn, Sch&ouml;ningh), and <span class="smcap">G. A. Barton</span> gave an article <i>On an old
Babylonian Letter addressed to Lushtamar</i> in the <i>Journal of the American
Oriental Society</i>, pp. 220-22.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. Schollmeyer</span> wrote on <i>Altbabylonische Privatbriefe</i> in <i>Babyloniaca</i>,
vi, pp. 57-64, 1912, and in 1911 published <i>Neuver&ouml;ffentlichte altbabylonische
Briefe und ihre Bedeutung f&uuml;r die Kultur des Orients: Sechs Vortr&auml;ge vor
der Hildesheimer Generalversammlung</i> (K&ouml;ln, P. Bachem).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. Ebeling</span> contributed to the <i>Revue d&#8217;Assyriologie</i>, 1913, pp. 15 ff.,
105-56, articles on <i>Altbabylonische Briefe</i>. <i>The First Letter of Rîm-Sin,
King of Larsa</i>, was published by <span class="smcap">St. Langdon</span> in the <i>Proceedings of the
Society for Biblical Archaeology</i>, 1911, pp. 221-2.</p>

<p>The period of the Third or Kassite Dynasty has not yet yielded much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. Radau</span> made as much as possible out of a number of fragments found
at Nippur in vol. xvii, 1 of Series A of <i>The Publications of the Babylonian
Expedition of the University of Pennsylvania</i> called <i>Letters to Cassite Kings
from the Temple Archives of Nippur</i> (1908).</p>

<p>Very little more is known of Epistolary Literature till we reach the
Sargonide Dynasty in Assyria. With the Library of Ashurbanipal at
Nineveh were found a large number of letters and dispatches, alike royal,
public and private, Assyrian and Neo-babylonian, which early attracted
notice. <span class="smcap">S. A. Smith</span> published a number from the collections in the
British Museum in his <i>Assyrian Letters from the Royal Library at Nineveh,
transcribed, translated, and explained</i> (Leipzig, Pfeiffer, 1887-1888), and in
<i>Miscellaneous Assyrian Texts of the British Museum with Textual Notes</i> (Leipzig,
Pfeiffer, 1887), besides a series of articles in the <i>Proceedings of the Society
of Biblical Archaeology</i> for 1887-1888 called <i>Assyrian Letters</i>.</p>

<p>The present writer dealt with <i>Sennacherib&#8217;s Letters to his Father Sargon</i>,
in the <i>Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology</i>, 1895, pp. 220-39.
<span class="smcap">Fr. Delitzsch</span> in the <i>Beitr&auml;ge zur Assyriologie</i>, vol. i, pp. 185-248, 613-31,
and vol. ii, pp. 19-62, under the title <i>Zur assyrisch-babylonischen Briefliteratur</i>,
laid deep the foundations of the study of letters, editing many
fresh texts (1890-1894). <span class="smcap">H. Winckler</span> published a large number of
letters in his <i>Sammlung von Keilschrifttexten</i> (Leipzig, Pfeiffer, 1894).
<span class="smcap">T. G. Pinches</span> published <i>Zwei assyrische Briefe</i> (Leipzig, Pfeiffer, 1887).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. F. Harper</span> has continued to edit the <i>Assyrian and Babylonian Letters
belonging to the Kouyunjik Collections of the British Museum</i>, vol. i, 1892;
vol. ii, 1893; vol. iii, 1896; vol. iv, 1896; vol. v, 1900; vol. vi, 1902;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
vol. vii, 1902; vol. viii, 1902; vol. ix, 1909; vol. x, 1911; vol. xi, 1911;
vol. xii, 1913; vol. xiii, 1913 (Chicago University Press; Luzac &amp; Co.,
London), which will contain all the British Museum collections from
Nineveh. These copies have been made with the greatest care, and constitute
the chief source of this material up to the present time. Numerous
works have been built upon them as foundation. <span class="smcap">Christopher Johnston</span>
wrote on <i>The Epistolary Literature of the Assyrians and Babylonians</i>
(Baltimore, 1898), reprinted from <i>Journal of the American Oriental Society</i>.
<span class="smcap">E. Behrens</span> published in 1906 his <i>Assyrisch-babylonische Briefe kultischen
Inhalts aus der Sargonidenzeit</i> (Leipzig, Pries, 1905). <span class="smcap">Lehmann-Haupt</span>
gave <i>Zwei unver&ouml;ffentlichte Keilschrifttexte</i> in <i>Hilprecht Anniversary Volume</i>
(1909), pp. 256-8.</p>

<p>In 1910 came <span class="smcap">M. Zeitlin&#8217;s</span> <i>Le style administratif chez les Assyriens; choix
de lettres assyriennes et babyloniennes, transcrites, traduites et accompagn&eacute;es de
notes</i> (Paris, Geuthner). In the <i>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Assyriologie</i> <span class="smcap">C. Bezold</span>
gave <i>Zwei assyrische Berichte</i> (vol. xxvi, 1912, p. 114-25).</p>

<p>In 1911, <span class="smcap">E. G. Klauber</span> wrote <i>Zur babylonisch-assyrischen Briefliteratur</i>
in <i>Babyloniaca</i>, iv, pp. 180-86; and in 1912 <i>Zur Politik und Kultur der
Sargonidenzeit: Untersuchungen auf Grand der Brieftexte</i> in the January and
July numbers of vol. xxviii of the <i>American Journal of Semitic Languages and
Literatures</i>. In the January number of this volume also appeared
<span class="smcap">L. Waterman&#8217;s</span> <i>Textual Notes on the Letters of the Sargon Period</i>. A most
valuable contribution to an obscure period of Ashurbanipal&#8217;s reign was
made by <span class="smcap">H. H. Figulla</span>, <i>Der Briefwechsel B&ecirc;libni&#8217;s: Historische Urkunden
aus der Zeit Asurbanipals</i>, in <i>Mitteilungen der Vorderasiatischen Gesellschaft</i>
(Leipzig, Hinrichs, 1912). <span class="smcap">E. G. Klauber</span>, in 1910, published <i>Assyrisches
Beamtentum nach Briefen aus der Sargonidenzeit</i> (Leipzig, Hinrichs), and
in <i>Der alte Orient</i>, xii, Heft 2, <i>Keilschriftbriefe: Staat und Gesellschaft
in der babylonisch-assyrischen Briefliteratur</i> (Leipzig, Hinrichs, 1911).
<span class="smcap">V. Scheil</span> under the title <i>Diplomatica</i> dealt with similar texts in the
<i>Hilprecht Anniversary Volume</i>, pp. 873 ff.</p>

<p>Letters of the Neo-Babylonian period are numerous but not much
published. <span class="smcap">R. C. Thompson</span> published <i>Late Babylonian Letters</i> (London,
Luzac &amp; Co., 1906) with translations, &amp;c. <span class="smcap">Fr. Martin</span> gave <i>Lettres n&eacute;o-babyloniennes</i>
(Paris, Champion, 1909), and <i>Trois lettres n&eacute;o-babyloniennes</i>
in the <i>Hilprecht Anniversary Volume</i>, 1909. In the <i>Proceedings of the
Society of Biblical Archaeology</i>, 1911, pp. 157-8, <span class="smcap">T. G. Pinches</span> published
<i>Two late Babylonian Letters</i>.</p>
